// THE PRODUCT FACE OF THE DESIGN RULES (docs/DESIGN_RULES_PLAN.md §5 R4).
//
// The ratified severity policy (owner, 2026-08-19): HARD where the MACHINE decides, WARNING
// where a HUMAN decides. The AI iterate loop keeps its blocking findings; on every PRODUCT
// surface - the editor's export panel, an import, a community publish - the same measurements
// land as WARNINGS ONLY, in plain language with the viewing context stated, and export never
// blocks on them. The catalog keeps its separate 20px hard type-floor gate unchanged
// (scripts/type-floor.mjs); the 312 audit-indicted designs stay shipped and simply carry the
// same warning every other surface does.
//
// The MEASUREMENT is `readabilityCheck.ts` / `tickerCheck.ts` - one instrument for the loop
// and the product, so the two can never disagree about what was measured. This module only
// rephrases the structured findings for a person, and states which viewing profile each
// warning was computed under (the same graphic warns differently for a phone than for a TV).
