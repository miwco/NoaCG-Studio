// The LIBRARY -> AIR gate, at production grain (docs/AGENT_SAVE.md "The boundary gates").
//
// A library record is allowed to be a broken draft - the editor saves half-finished work, and
// an agent's save door stores a record the server never executed. What may NOT happen is a
// broken graphic reaching a renderer somebody else is pointing a camera at: the hosted publish
// (control/hostedControl.ts publishControlShow) and every production export
// (export/showExport.ts) run THIS before they do anything, and the production export dialog
// shows the same verdict the builder will enforce, so "the button was enabled but the build
// refused" cannot happen.
//
// Product promise, stated once: an invalid graphic cannot publish or export. The gate is
// `publishGate` per pool graphic over the LIVE library template (what actually ships), the
// same gate the community door and the bridge's validator run - one gate, several doors.
