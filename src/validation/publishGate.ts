// THE PUBLISH GATE - the ONE pure function that decides whether a template may leave the
// author's own editor for somewhere it will be trusted: the community gallery, a hosted
// production (publish), a production export, the agent save door's re-gate on open. It
// composes the two automated checks - validateTemplate (SPX-contract correctness) and
// templateBench (share-safety) - into a single pass/fail with a merged issue list.
//
// It began life as src/community/gate.ts (Era 5.5, the gallery's publish/import gate), and
// moved here when it became the LIBRARY->AIR gate too (docs/AGENT_SAVE.md): the hosted publish
// path (control/hostedControl.ts) and the production exporter (export/showExport.ts) run it,
// and a processing domain reaching into the community feature for its gate read wrong. The
// community module re-exports it, so nothing there changed.
//
// Why templateBench's unsafe-JS findings are ERRORS rather than warnings: with no reviewer
// downstream, a warning is a note nobody reads. It is a screen, not a sandbox (a determined
// author can evade a regex), so it does not make importing a stranger's template safe on its
// own - it makes publishing hostile code deliberate rather than accidental, and it stops the
// four opt-in blocks (live data, show chat, remote/hosted control) being shared pointing at the
// author's own backend.

import { validateTemplate, type ValidationIssue, type ValidationResult } from './validateTemplate';
import { runBench } from './templateBench';

// A shared template must be fully self-contained: no external dependency (the offline-first
// pillar) and no reference to an asset the package doesn't carry. validateTemplate treats these
// as warnings for the general export path; for sharing and for air they block. `.supabase.co`
// refs are already exempted inside validateTemplate, so an opt-in realtime block still passes.
