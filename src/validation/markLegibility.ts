// CAN THE BRAND MARK ACTUALLY BE SEEN?
//
// The owner's blind value-gate ballot (2026-08-14, `docs/AI_LITE_BRAND_PLAN.md` §2.2) failed on
// this and almost nothing else: a knockout mark on a light package painted white ink on a white
// panel, and the graphic shipped looking like a lower third with no logo at all. It failed on the
// GENERATED arm and on the hand-branded WIZARD arm equally - the owner's words, "white on white
// will never work... we should have all these obvious rules already".
//
// Two facts made that possible, and this module answers both:
//
//   · `logo_ink_unreadable_on_surface` (src/ai/lite/contract.ts) is RECORDED and nothing is done
//     with it. That was a deliberate §3.7 decision - the painted well was worse than the defect -
//     but recording is not telling, and the ledger is not a place a user looks.
//   · the wizard's own branding records nothing at all: `variant.create()` puts the mark where the
//     design says and no gate downstream ever asks whether it can be read there.
//
// So the question is asked of the RENDERED graphic, which is the only place it can be answered:
// the mark's ink is the user's file, the surface under it is the design's decision composited
// with the user's palette, and neither one alone predicts the pair. `scripts/ai-lite-brand-audit.mjs`
// has measured exactly this since 2026-08-09 - over CATALOG chassis with FIXTURE marks. This is the
// same measurement moved to where the user's own graphic passes.
//
// It REPORTS and never repairs. §3.7 ruled out both available repairs (drop the customer's mark,
// or paste a plate over the design), and the remaining honest move is to say so while the person
// choosing the colours is still there to choose differently.
