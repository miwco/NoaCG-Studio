// The on-air readiness report: what was ALREADY measured, grouped into things an operator
// cares about.
//
// The runtime bench exercises a generated graphic hard — field binding, the entrance, every
// branch state, the exit, a replay, and a doubled-text stress lap — and validateTemplate
// checks the export contract on top. All of it reached the user as one line: "✓ Passes SPX
// validation and the live playout test", or a list of raw rule messages when it did not.
// That undersells the strongest thing the platform does and gives a failing result no shape.
//
// This adds NO checks. It is a pure reading of findings that already exist, which is what
// keeps it honest: a row can only report what was actually run.
