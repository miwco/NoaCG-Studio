 *
 * Occlusion rides the SAME rule rather than the bench's looser majority. The bench samples
 * three points in the hold and accepts two, because it is a reporting tool and a missed
 * observation costs nothing. This is a gate: a finding here spends a repair round, and a
 * transition that legitimately sweeps a panel across the hero would be flagged by a majority
 * of two. Requiring the hero to be covered at every checked frame keeps that case clean and
 * still catches the failure that was measured shipping - text parked behind a panel for the
 * whole hold, covered at every sample.

 * rounds, but once those rounds are spent they demote to warnings rather than throw away a
 * composition the user waited for - the right call when the finding might be a false positive
 * or a legible near-miss.
 *
 * `text-occluded` is soft for the same reason as `text-clip`: the hit test samples five points
 * and can be fooled by a decorative layer that is technically painted, so it drives repair
 * rounds but does not throw finished work away on its own.
 *
 * `text-clip-total` is NOT soft, and is deliberately absent from SOFT_RULES. At 100% loss the
 * visible extent of the line is zero: nothing of it is painted at any checked hold frame.
 * That is not a marginal crop and it cannot be a false positive, so demoting it ships a
 * composition whose text the viewer will never see - measured happening (docs/
 * HYPERFRAMES_QUALITY.md, the re-measurement's r1, which shipped both lines fully clipped
 * after two failed repair rounds). A partial crop keeps the old, forgiving behaviour.
