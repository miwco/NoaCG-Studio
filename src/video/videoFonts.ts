// The fonts bundled into the AI VIDEO world - so a generated composition can set real
// broadcast type instead of only the OS system stack (the video world's typography
// ceiling was the reason premium output looked generic). Single source of truth: the SAME
// seven OFL faces the SPX side bundles (model/fonts.ts), re-shaped for video with a genre
// hint the motion skills teach.
//
// The @font-face CSS is built HERE and injected IDENTICALLY into both worlds so what you
// preview is what renders (parity is the whole point):
//   - preview: scripts/build-player-host.mjs inlines these as data-URL @font-face into the
//     player host page at build time (the host iframe has an opaque origin, so a served
//     font URL would be a cross-origin CORS request every static server refuses - the
//     bytes must be embedded, exactly like the host's inlined JS);
//   - render: scripts/gen-video-font-css.mjs emits the same data-URL CSS as a module the
//     render worker imports and injects, behind a delayRender font-load gate.
// This module carries only metadata + the CSS builder (never the base64), so it stays
// cheap to import from the app (the AI contract reads the family list), from the render
// worker, and from the Node build scripts. It is deliberately SELF-CONTAINED (no import of
// model/fonts.ts): the two injectors run under different module resolvers (Node's native
// TS loader, the render worker's webpack), and a self-contained data table resolves
// everywhere with no extension/resolution friction. The files mirror model/fonts.ts (the
// SPX bundle) - the video world curates its own subset here; the build scripts read the
// actual woff2 by these names, so a stale name fails the build loudly rather than silently.
