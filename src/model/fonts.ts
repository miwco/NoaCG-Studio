 *   a hairline rule and a kicker are structure, not decoration.
 * - **cinematic** — the documentary/title-card voice. No panel edge at all; text sits on a soft
 *   scrim and carries its own shadow, set in light, widely tracked caps. It is the one family
 *   whose display type OPENS UP (positive tracking) instead of tightening.
 *
 * Both are full families: they carry a FAMILY_TOKENS row (model/themeTokens.ts), palettes, font
 * affinities, and wizard filter chips, exactly like the original four.
