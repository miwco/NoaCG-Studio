# src/model - the data layer

Loaded alongside the root CLAUDE.md when working in this directory. Keep it accurate.

- **types.ts** - SpxTemplate (html/css/js + parsed definition - the canonical unit), Resolution,
  ASPECTS, AssetFile, DEFAULT_SETTINGS.
- **spxDefinition.ts** - parse/serialize the `window.SPXGCTemplateDefinition` block inside the
  template HTML.
- **structure.ts** - detectPrefix/countLines + getTemplateParts, the TemplatePart registry: THE
  shared element-identity contract. Numbered sibling families are recognised the same way the
  quiz's `.<prefix>-option-N` rows are: `.<prefix>-level-N` (the alert category's severity
  blocks) each become their own part, labelled by the level word they carry, because the level
  machine gives each one its own opacity track and one shared class matching four elements has
  nowhere to put four different values. DOM-derived `{selector, kind, label, channel}`, single-token
  selectors only. Timeline labels, canvas selection, and step assignment must all name elements
  through it. A masked text line is recognised under ITS OWN graphic's prefix: the host's, or an
  INSERTED graphic's namespaced one (a `data-gfx` root carrying its own `-box` -
  blocks/templateInsert.ts). Such parts carry `inserted: true`, which is how they can be full
  registry parts (selectable, animatable, named by their field titles) while `countLines` - "how
  many lines does THIS design have", what the preset emitters size choreography from - keeps
  counting the host's only.
- **wizard.ts** - categories, variants, WizardOptions, palettes. A variant declares its
  CAPABILITIES - `maxLines` (1-5 line capacity), `logo: 'none' | 'optional' | 'built-in'`,
  `animationPresets` - which drive the wizard's Fields/Animation options AND the Template
  step's filter chips, so a new family inherits both automatically. Sizing is two knobs:
  `sizeScale` (--scale, whole graphic) and `typeScale` (--type-scale, text only).
- **fonts.ts** - bundled OFL fonts registry + CustomFont import helpers.
- **themeTokens.ts** - the SHAPE half of the `:root` style contract, and DESIGN_LANGUAGE §8's
  family table in code: panel blur/radius/shadow/keyline, accent weight/glow/ink, the label
  face + tracking + colour, display weight + tracking, with values for all four `StyleTag`
  families. `resolveTokens(family, ...overrides)` layers a design's disagreements over its
  family; **that override map is conformance debt, and its size is the metric** (§8's own rule
  is "reuse the exact token values, don't improvise per category"). `tokenVarsCss` emits ONLY
  the tokens the consuming stylesheet actually reads - same no-dead-knobs doctrine as the
  imported design's missing `--type-scale`. Values are complete CSS values (`calc(18px *
  var(--scale))`, `none`, `50%`), never bare numbers, so one token covers a scaled length, a
  keyword and a percentage without the consuming rule knowing which it got. Shadow-slot
  neutral is `NO_SHADOW` (`0 0 0 0 transparent`), because these compose into comma-separated
  `box-shadow` lists and `none, none` is invalid CSS. Deliberately absent: density (unmeasured,
  genuinely per-design), the sport skew (`skewX(0deg)` is not inert - it makes a stacking
  context), and motion feel (it lives in the NOACG_ANIM block, not in CSS).
- **brand.ts** - ProjectBrand save/load (localStorage 'spx-gfx-brand'), captured on every wizard
  Create.
- **library.ts** - the GRAPHICS LIBRARY (docs/SAVED_CONTENT_MODEL.md): every durably saved
  graphic is ONE `GraphicDoc` with a STABLE uuid ('spx-gfx-graphics', sync kind 'graphic',
  supabase migration 0009) - template + baseline + `packageId` (null = standalone) + the
  control panel's `entries` (`ControlEntry` named data rows) + `activeEntryId`. Packet
  conventions (updatedAt LWW, tombstones). `migrateEmbeddedGraphics` extracts v1 packets'
  embedded graphics into the library UNDER THEIR OWN ids (convergent across devices) and
  rewrites the packet as version 2; it runs on every loadAllGraphics.
- **packets.ts** - PACKAGES (v2: folders over the library - graphics point back via
  packageId; the legacy `graphics` array stays a real empty array so older builds never
  crash) + brand looks 'spx-gfx-looks' + captureLookFromTemplate/applyLookToTemplate.
- **shows.ts** - the RUNDOWN unit (docs/CONTROL_LAYER.md): an ORDERED set of graphics that run
  together, one aggregated control page. Packet conventions ('spx-gfx-shows', updatedAt LWW,
  tombstones), sync kind 'show'; `hostedSlug` records the published control page's capability.
- **easings.ts** - the easing catalog; the doctrine is in src/templates/CLAUDE.md +
  DESIGN_LANGUAGE §4.
- **defaultTemplate.ts** - the fallback template.
- **project.ts** - the current working project, autosaved to localStorage 'spx-gfx-project' so a
  reload restores the last graphic. One slot: creating a new graphic overwrites it (durable saves
  go to the LIBRARY via the Save button). Carries the save LINK - `graphicId` (which library
  record this document IS) + `dirty` - so a reload keeps an honest Saved/Unsaved badge.
  Soft-delete tombstone for cloud-sync parity.
- **importTemplate.ts** - import an EXISTING template (.html file or SPX-style zip) and split it
  into the editor's three panes; foreign templates rarely follow the house contracts, so the
  Style/Motion panels degrade gracefully, validation shows what's missing, and the AI panel's
  "Make SPX-ready" is the guided fix path.
- **layout.ts** - the desktop DOCKABLE-PANEL layout (localStorage 'spx-gfx-layout', version 3):
  three docks (left/right/bottom), each a `DockState` {panels, active, size}, plus `timelineSize`
  (the centre's canvas/timeline split). `PanelId` = code | inspector | data | control | style |
  assets | ai | export. A panel not in any dock is intentionally CLOSED (not re-added on load -
  AppShell offers it from a dock's "+"). loadLayout migrates: v2 gets 'assets' inserted once
  right after 'style' (v2 semantics say absent = closed, so without the version bump no existing
  user would ever see the new tab); anything older resets to the default; the mobile layout
  ignores all of this. See src/components/CLAUDE.md (AppShell / WorkspaceDock).
- **prefs.ts** - small device-level workflow defaults (localStorage 'spx-gfx-prefs'):
  defaultExportTarget, timelineCollapsed, renderSettings, commentVisibility (the code editors'
  comment view mode - src/editor/). Not synced; keep it tiny.
- **id.ts** - uuid() that ALWAYS returns a valid RFC-4122 v4, even where crypto.randomUUID is
  undefined (plain-HTTP LAN hosts, CasparCG's CEF). Record ids must be real UUIDs: the cloud
  `documents.id` column is a uuid PK, and a non-UUID id would be rejected by Postgres and poison
  sync.
- **videoTypes.ts** - VideoProject, the canonical unit of the AI VIDEO editor ("Video or
  animation with AI"): ONE composition source + duration/fps/size/transparency + assets (the
  exact AssetFile shape, sync-ready) + `inputs` (editable inputs, below) + AI chat history and
  motion plan. Parallel to SpxTemplate - the two worlds never mix; `kind: 'video'` is the
  serialized discriminant. **`engine: 'remotion' | 'hyperframes'`** (VIDEO_ENGINES carries the
  wizard-card metadata) picks which source field is live - `tsx` (a single-file React/Remotion
  module, the default) or `html` (a standalone HyperFrames composition; runtime in
  src/video/hyperframes/) - chosen at creation, never converted; read/write the active source
  through `videoSource(p)`/`withVideoSource(p, code)`. Records stored before the field load as
  'remotion' (videoProject.ts normalize). Also DocKind and createDefaultVideoProject
  (engine-matched starter composition).
  **VideoInput** = the video project's Template Definition, the counterpart of an SPX
  DataField: `{ key, type: text|number|color|select|image, label, value, default, options?/
  min?/max?/step? }`. The AI declares a handful (via the emit tool) so a non-technical user
  edits the content in the Content panel WITHOUT touching TSX; the composition reads them from
  its `fields` prop as `fields.<key> ?? default`. An `image` input's value is the LOGICAL NAME
  of a project asset (the counterpart of an SPX `filelist` filename): the composition resolves
  it against the `assets` prop it already receives (`assets[String(fields.logo ?? '')]`), so an
  image input adds NO bytes to the render manifest budget. `videoFieldValues(inputs)` builds
  the `{key: value}` bag passed as `fields` into BOTH the live preview (VideoPlayerFrame
  set-props) and the render (buildVideoManifest inputProps). `mergeVideoInputs(prev, next)`
  adopts a regenerated set while keeping values the user already edited - and a provider that
  simply DIDN'T re-declare its inputs must send `null`, not `[]`, or the merge empties the user's
  Content panel and reverts their text to the code defaults (`[]` means "no editable content" and
  is honoured as such; see ai/video/claudeVideoProvider.ts).
  `videoInputDescriptor(input)` is the adapter to the shared `FieldDescriptor` (fieldModel.ts)
  the Content panel renders - the same descriptor an SPX DataField becomes.
  **`authoredFor`** = the settings the current code was WRITTEN against (null until a generation
  lands). The AI plans motion to a duration and a frame and writes the resulting numbers into the
  code; changing the settings afterwards changes the player and the renderer but NOT that code, so
  a shortened piece loses its exit and a composition that paints its own background still renders
  opaque under `transparent`. `settingsDrift(project)` says what no longer matches, in the user's
  words, and `driftRequest(project)` is the refinement that brings the code up to date (the
  Settings panel's one-click offer).
- **videoInputInfer.ts** - reads a composition's editable inputs OUT OF ITS CODE: every
  `fields.<key> ?? <literal>` the module reads, typed from the fallback (a hex string is a colour,
  a number is a number, an `assets[String(fields.x ?? '')]` lookup is an image). The code is the
  source of truth, so it decides what is editable - a hand-written field gets the same control the
  AI would have declared. `contentInputs(declared, tsx)` is what the Content panel shows: declared
  inputs first and unchanged (they carry labels/options/bounds a fallback can't express), then
  whatever else the code reads. A read with NO literal fallback is ignored on purpose - without a
  default there is nothing to show, reset to, or type the control from.
- **fieldModel.ts** - the canonical editable-field vocabulary shared across the two authoring
  worlds. `FieldKind` = the kinds the product supports (text/lines/number/color/select/toggle/
  image); the video Template Definition uses the `VideoFieldKind` subset (`VideoInputType`,
  text/number/color/select/image). **`FieldDescriptor`** is the shared SHAPE both worlds adapt
  into - `{key, label, kind, defaultValue, options?, min?/max?/step?}` - plus `FieldValue`
  (string | number) and `clampToField`. An SPX DataField becomes one via control/controlModel.ts
  `fieldDescriptors`; a VideoInput via videoTypes.ts `videoInputDescriptor`. **Every surface that
  edits a field renders descriptors, never raw fields**, so the SPX Data panel, the SPX operator
  panel, and the video Content panel are literally the same component
  (components/fields/FieldControl.tsx) and cannot drift. A new field kind is added HERE, mapped
  in the two adapters, and rendered once.
- **videoProject.ts** - video persistence mirroring project.ts/packets.ts: current slot
  'spx-gfx-video-project' (autosave; returns false on quota so the shell can WARN - video
  assets are big) + saved list 'spx-gfx-video-saved' with soft-delete tombstones.
- **docKind.ts** - the persisted editor-world switch ('spx-gfx-doc-kind'); App.tsx branches
  AppShell vs VideoAppShell on it. Falls back to 'spx' when the video slot is empty.
- **videoLayout.ts** - the video shell's own layout prefs (localStorage 'spx-gfx-video-layout'):
  just codeRatio + codeCollapsed. Separate from layout.ts on purpose - the video shell has a
  simple code|preview split, not the SPX dockable workspace.
