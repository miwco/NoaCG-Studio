// Data model for the AI video project type ("Video or animation with AI").
//
// A VideoProject is the canonical unit of the video editor - a single-file React/Remotion
// composition plus its settings, assets, and AI iteration history. It lives in a world
// PARALLEL to SpxTemplate (live HTML graphics): its own store, its own persistence slots,
// its own editor shell. The two never mix; `kind` discriminates them wherever records may
// later share storage (the cloud `documents` table, mixed saved lists).
//
// The composition source (`tsx`) is the source of truth, exactly like html/css/js is for
// SPX templates: AI and panels emit real code, the editor shows exactly what runs, and the
// SAME compiled module drives the live preview and the final render.

 * An editable composition input - the video-project counterpart of an SPX DataField. The AI
 * declares a handful (the headline, an accent colour, a score, a logo image) so a
 * non-technical user can change the content in the Content panel WITHOUT touching TSX. The
 * kinds are a subset of the shared field vocabulary (model/fieldModel.ts) - the same kinds
 * the SPX operator controls speak - so one Template Definition across Remotion/SPX/operator
 * controls drops in naturally. The `key` is the prop name the composition reads:
 * `fields.<key>` (always with a `?? default` fallback so the code still renders standalone).
 * Values ride into both the preview and the render inside `inputProps`.
 *
 * Value shape by type: text/color/select carry a string, number a number, and `image` carries
 * the LOGICAL NAME of a project asset (the video counterpart of an SPX `filelist` filename) -
 * the composition resolves it against the `assets` map it already receives, e.g.
 * `assets[String(fields.logo ?? '')]`. An empty string means "none". Because the asset URL
 * lives in `assets`, not the field value, an image input adds no bytes to the manifest budget.

 * that paints its own background still renders opaque.

 * offer to fix it, instead of silently rendering something the user didn't ask for. `null` on
 * a project whose code no AI has written yet - the starter composition derives everything from
 * useVideoConfig, so it fits any settings, and a hand-written module is its author's business.
