// Data model for the AI video project type ("Video or animation with AI").
//
// A VideoProject is the canonical unit of the video editor - a single-file React/Remotion
// composition plus its settings, assets, and AI iteration history. It lives in a world
// PARALLEL to SpxTemplate (live HTML graphics): its own store, its own persistence slots,
// its own editor shell. The two never mix; `kind` discriminates them wherever records may
// later share storage (the cloud `documents` table, mixed saved lists).
//
// The composition source (`tsx`) is the source of truth, exactly like html/css/js is for
// SPX templates: AI and panels emit real code, the editor shows exactly what runs, and the
// SAME compiled module drives the live preview and the final render.

 * Values ride into both the preview and the render inside `inputProps`.

 * the LOGICAL NAME of a project asset (the video counterpart of an SPX `filelist` filename) -
 * the composition resolves it against the `assets` map it already receives, e.g.
