// The DURABLE STORE - where the heavy saved documents actually live.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. localStorage caps an origin at roughly 5 MB, and a saved graphic is far
// bigger than its code: an uploaded image is a base64 data URL (+33%), localStorage stores
// UTF-16 so every character costs two bytes (x2), and a library record keeps the Reset
// baseline, a second copy of the same template (x2). A 150 KB logo therefore costs ~820 KB of
// the quota, the library fills after about ten graphics, and every save from then on fails.
// That is a real failure the owner hit in use, not a theoretical limit.
//
// IndexedDB replaces localStorage - the same layer (the browser, offline-first, no account),
// with a quota measured in gigabytes rather than megabytes. It does NOT replace the Supabase
// backend, which is the server layer an account unlocks; the product wants both.
//
// THE SHAPE. IndexedDB is asynchronous and localStorage is not, and the whole app reads these
// documents synchronously - from React renders, from module scope (templateStore reads the
// autosaved project as it loads), from the sync engine. So this module keeps a synchronous
// in-memory MIRROR and persists behind it:
//
//   read   - answered from the mirror, synchronously, exactly like localStorage
//   write  - updates the mirror synchronously, then queues a serialized IndexedDB put
//   hydrate- once, before the app mounts (src/main.tsx), so no read ever races the mirror
//
// Every model module keeps the signatures it had. What changes is WHEN a write's success is
// known: not on return, but a moment later. So a refusal cannot come back as that call's return
// value, and it is announced instead - `spx-storage-error`, which App.tsx turns into the same
// "Could not save" dialog and failed save status a synchronous quota error used to produce. Two
// rules keep that honest rather than merely loud:
//
//   - a refused write ROLLS THE MIRROR BACK, so the app never spends the session showing an
//     edit that no reload will reproduce ("the library keeps the last good copy" is true
//     immediately, not only after a refresh);
//   - every write is ATTEMPTED. An earlier refusal never blocks a later save - that is what
//     makes freeing space recover without a reload, and a "the store is full" latch that
//     short-circuits the next write deadlocks exactly the write that would clear it.
//
// The `try { setItem } catch { return 'Browser storage is full...' }` branches in the model
// modules therefore no longer fire against IndexedDB; they remain the live path in the
// degraded localStorage fallback below, where setItem really does throw.
//
// WHAT LIVES HERE, AND WHAT DOES NOT. Only the heavy documents move: the graphics library,
// productions, the working graphic and video slots, the saved videos, looks, and the retired
// packet store (which a legacy migration still reads). Small device preferences - prefs,
// layout, doc kind, brand, AI settings, sync metadata - stay in localStorage: they are
// kilobytes, they are read before hydration by design, and the E2E suite seeds several of
// them through `addInitScript`, which cannot reach IndexedDB.
//
// DEGRADING HONESTLY. A browser with no IndexedDB (private modes, locked-down embedders) or a
// database written by a NEWER build (a higher version number, which `open` rejects) falls back
// to localStorage for everything - the old ~5 MB ceiling, but never a crash and never eaten
// data. An older build reading a migrated profile finds the localStorage keys gone and starts
// empty rather than corrupt; the IndexedDB copy is untouched and returns when the newer build
// does. That is the reason the migration is one-way and marked, not a mirror kept in sync.
