// The production's LIVE data tree - runtime state, deliberately NOT part of the Show record.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL: `Show` syncs record-level last-write-wins with conflict copies,
// and a conflict copy drops the production's capability slugs (docs/INTERACTIVE_PLAYOUT_PLAN.md
// D3). Live values move at feed rate - a clock, a score during a period - so writing them into
// the show document would bump `updatedAt` per tick, push a document sync per tick, and make a
// two-operator production mint a conflict copy that unpublishes itself mid-show. The authored
// SEED lives on the record (it is authored, it should travel, it should be exported and
// duplicated); what is true right now lives here.
//
// Plain localStorage, not the durable IndexedDB store: this is small, per-machine, never
// synced, and it changes often enough that queueing every write into the durable store's
// commit path would be churn with nothing to show for it. It survives a reload, which is the
// one durability property runtime state actually needs.
