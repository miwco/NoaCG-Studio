// THE THEME TOKEN CONTRACT — the shape half of the :root style contract.
//
// The colour half already existed: --accent / --text-color / --text-dim / --panel-bg /
// --font-heading / --scale / --type-scale (templates/shared/base.ts rootVarsCss). Everything
// that actually distinguishes the four style families in practice — panel treatment, radius,
// shadow, keyline, accent geometry, the label typeface and its tracking — was a hand-typed
// literal in every variant's CSS, mirrored by eye from the table in DESIGN_LANGUAGE §8.
//
// This file is that table, in code. §8 stays the prose rationale; these are the values.
//
// **Why tokens and not an override block.** A theme has to be re-applicable — the whole point
// of a types × themes catalog is that the same design is emitted in four looks — and an
// appended override block is not idempotent, cannot reach the JS the motion lives in, and
// fights the Style panel over the same declarations. Reading a variable is none of those
// things, and it keeps the generated CSS readable, which is a product pillar.
//
// **Values are complete CSS values, not numbers.** `calc(18px * var(--scale))`, not `18`. That
// is what lets one token cover a scaled length, a percentage and a keyword (`50%`, `999px`,
// `none`) without the consuming rule needing to know which it got.

import type { StyleTag } from './fonts';

/** A shadow slot that contributes nothing. `none` cannot be used: these tokens compose into
 *  comma-separated `box-shadow` lists, and `none, none` is not valid CSS. A zero-size
 *  transparent shadow is, and paints nothing. */
export const NO_SHADOW = '0 0 0 0 transparent';

/**
 * The shape tokens. Every one is a CSS value, and every one has a family default below.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT here yet:
 * - **density / padding** — DESIGN_LANGUAGE has no density row, padding is genuinely
 *   per-design (a lower third and an infographic do not share one), and it is the one
 *   designAdjust dimension that has never worked (it reads the auto-fit rule, which has no
 *   padding). It needs measuring before it needs tokenizing.
 * - **the sport skew** — `transform: skewX(0deg)` is not inert: it creates a stacking context
 *   and can change text rasterization, so a "neutral" skew token would not be neutral. It
 *   stays a literal until the render baseline proves otherwise.
 * - **motion feel** — motion lives in the NOACG_ANIM data block in the JS, not in CSS. It
 *   belongs to a theme, but it does not belong in :root.

/**
 * The four families. Values are DESIGN_LANGUAGE §8's, cross-checked against a census of what
 * the 52 catalog stylesheets actually ship — per family AND per element role, because a
 * tracking or a glow means nothing until you know whether it is on the heading, the label or
 * the accent bar. Where the doc and the code disagreed, the note says which won and why.
 *
 * Confidence, from that census — it predicts where the override maps will fill up:
 *
 * - **Strong** (a clear majority ships one value): panelBlur (noacg 6/6 `blur(8px)`, glass
 *   9/10 `blur(18px)`), fontLabel (noacg 8/8 JetBrains Mono), labelColor (minimal 7/11
 *   `--text-dim`, noacg 3/3 `--accent`), displayTracking (minimal 6/19, glass 5/10, sport
 *   5/15 all clear modes), panelRadius for minimal/sport/noacg.
 * - **Weak — expect overrides**: panelShadow is per-design far more than per-family (sport
 *   ships five shadows across five variants, no two alike); glass panelRadius genuinely
 *   ranges 12–18 px, as §8 itself says.
 *
 * Where doc and code diverged:
 * - §8 gives the house chip radius as 6 px. NOTHING in the catalog ships 6 px (bug02's mark
 *   bars are 3 px, lt14 cites the token while shipping neither). Not encoded — a fiction in
 *   the doc should not become a fiction in the code.
 * - §8 gives sport a "hard offset (sticker-slab)" shadow. First encoded as NO_SHADOW (the
 *   flagship slabs sb01/qz01 read no shadow at all), but the full-matrix review found every
 *   sport READER painting its own — a default serving nobody. Now lt07's hard offset, as the
 *   starting point §8 intended; the loud ones (gt03/gt04's sticker stacks, vs01's halo) keep
 *   overriding, and that is intent, not debt (THEME_DEFAULTS_REVIEW).
 * - The minimal keyline is 0.14 in §8, 0.15 in §3, and 0.10/0.18/0.12 in ig06. §8 wins as the
 *   named authority; ig06 carries the difference as a variant override until it is reviewed.
 *
 * And where the census corrected a value read off a single example:
 * - noacg labelTracking is 0.2em (the mode, lt13+lt14), not lt11's 0.22em.
 * - glass displayTracking is -0.01em (5 of 10 uses), not 0.
 *
 * Re-valued by the full-matrix review (2026-07-21, THEME_DEFAULTS_REVIEW.md), which measured
 * every override's direction rather than a single example:
 * - sport labelTracking 0.08em -> 0.14em: all seven sport overrides moved UP from 0.08, none
 *   down — the old value found the right element but the wrong number.
 * - sport displayWeight 700 -> 800: every override climbed (800x3, 900x2); §8's
 *   "condensed/heavy caps" was a floor sport kept climbing off.
 * - sport displayTracking 0.02em -> -0.01em: four of five overrides adopted the other three
 *   families' value; §8's "sport opens up and shouts" is about labels, not display tracking.
 *   All four families now sit at -0.01em — whether this stays a family token is an open
 *   modelling question (ig07's 0.12em shows it already covers two roles).
