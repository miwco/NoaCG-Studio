// THE TIMELINE LENS — which timeline the step surface is editing.
//
// A graphic's motion lives in two places: the default path's `steps`, and a branch state's
// own `state.timeline` (docs/STATE_MACHINE_SCHEMA.md §2). The step timeline and the Inspector
// were written against the first — every mutator in animEdit.ts takes a step INDEX, and both
// surfaces read `data.steps[i]`.
//
// Teaching each of those a second address would mean touching every mutator. Instead we
// PROJECT: reading a branch target hands the surfaces an AnimData whose single step IS that
// state's timeline, so animEdit, animEval, the keyframe drags and the Inspector all keep
// working unchanged; writing folds the edited step back into the state it came from.
//
// The target lives in templateStore, not in the dock's local state, because the Inspector
// resolves values and stamps keyframes against the SAME projection — a component-local target
// would have it editing the entrance while the timeline showed a branch.
