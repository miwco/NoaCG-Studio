// THE UNIVERSAL IN/OUT MOTION BANK — ten entrance/exit motions that apply to ANY graphic
// whose motion lives in the NOACG_ANIM data block (docs/STATE_MACHINE_SCHEMA.md): the
// catalog, the wizard's imports, the agent door's scaffolds, a hand-made data template.
//
// This is the no-code surface's engine (the wizard's Animation step and a saved graphic's
// control page both pick from it); the full timeline stays the Advanced-mode editor. It is
// deliberately NOT another category preset bank (blocks/presetRegistry.ts): those are the
// catalog's tuned choreographies — lines staggering out of masks, an accent drawing in —
// emitted as code and derived to keyframes through the importer, and each one needs the
// structure contract it was written for. A universal motion knows nothing about the
// design: it moves THE GRAPHIC AS ONE UNIT, so it can promise to work on every data-block
// graphic, and it is authored directly as DATA (plain keyframe tracks), so applying it is a
// pure `(data) => data` transform — deterministic, readable, undoable, and the same in the
// wizard, on the control page and under SPX.
//
// WHAT MOVES: the graphic's root's direct element children (its box, an accent beside it —
// whatever sits directly under the root), together, with one motion. The root itself never
// takes a track: the interpreter owns its opacity (the rest-hide and the on-air reveal), and
// a track there would fight it. Layers OUTSIDE the root keep their own motion — an inserted
// graphic shares the host's steps but is not the host's unit (blocks/templateInsert.ts).
//
// WHAT IS KEPT on the step being rewritten: lifecycle `calls` (a clock's startClock), measured
// `dynamics` (a ticker's marquee builder), `loops` (an ambient breath — it is behaviour, not
// the entrance), `reveals`/`hides` (the walk's mechanics), and every layer outside the root.
// Only the inside-the-root ENTRANCE/EXIT motion is swapped, which is what the picker says it
// does. A styled lifecycle edge (a machine's play/stop arrow carrying fade/push/wipe) would
// play INSTEAD of the step's keyframes, so the rewrite clears that style — what you picked
// is what plays.
//
// Values follow the catalog's own taste (templates/lowerThirds/animPresets.ts, the imported
// design's whole-unit bank): Out-direction eases on entrances, In-direction eases on exits
// that run ~45 % faster (docs/DESIGN_LANGUAGE.md §4).
//
// MEASURED, 2026-08-23 (the owner, after animating an imported SVG: "I used the wipe-write
// animation and didn't really see a difference … the speed, I don't notice the difference and
// everything looks too similar"). The wizard's Animation step was driven for real and the
// composed preview read back frame by frame (the method and the easing half of the result are
// in model/easings.ts). The motion half:
//
//  - The Speed knob REACHES the data (NOACG_ANIM.speed lands as 0.75 / 1 / 1.5 and the
//    interpreter genuinely time-scales by it). It was invisible because of what it scaled: at
//    a 0.55 s entrance, Slower/Normal/Faster meant 0.73 / 0.55 / 0.37 s — a 0.18 s step, and
//    the WHOLE range sat at or under the doctrine's 0.5 s floor, so every setting read as
//    "fast". The base durations below were lengthened (in ≈ 0.8 s, out ≈ 0.45 s) so the same
//    0.75/1.5 knob now spans ≈ 1.07 / 0.80 / 0.53 s — three settings inside the doctrine's
//    0.5–1.4 s band instead of three shades of the same one.
//  - "Everything looks too similar" and "no curve changes anything" were ONE fault: travel.
//    The bank moved 40 px (y) / 60 px (x) on a 1920×1080 frame — under 4 % — so neither the
//    motion nor the curve shaping it had room to read, and every out-direction ease landed
//    within 4–6 px of every other. Travel was widened to ~10 % of the frame, which is what
//    gives an easing choice something to be visible IN.
//
// The old note here read "short travel (a rise reads as 'arriving', not as movement)". That was
// the intent; the measurement is that at 40 px it read as neither.
//
// SECOND ROUND, 2026-08-26 (the owner's 2026-08-25 walk: easing accepted, Speed still "does not
// change, at least in the preview"). The lengthened durations were in and the knob still did not
// read - a ±33% step compared from MEMORY across two replays is below the noticing threshold on
// a smooth power curve, and his own hypothesis ("do I need an ease on it?") was the clue: bounce
// made it visible because the bounce COUNT changes, a rhythm rather than a duration. The knob's
// STEPS were widened instead (model/wizard.ts AnimSpeed, 0.6/1/1.8): the same 0.8 s entrance now
// spans ≈ 1.33 / 0.80 / 0.44 s. Nothing here changed - the bank's durations stay speed-relative.
