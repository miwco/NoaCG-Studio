# src/blocks - deterministic template transforms

Loaded alongside the root CLAUDE.md when working in this directory. Keep it accurate.

Everything here is a pure `(template) => template` transform that emits clean, commented code
(root non-negotiables 1, 2 and 5). The panels, canvas, and timeline are thin UIs over these
patchers.

## registry.ts - building blocks

BuildingBlock[] - there is no Blocks tab anymore; this is the offline AI stub's vocabulary. Pure
transforms grouped by a hierarchical `path` (e.g. `['Lower third']`, `['Animation','GSAP']`) with
a `primaryTab` (the tab to reveal after applying). Inserted elements are positioned in the
lower-left action-safe area via `positionForNewElement`, tagged `data-gfx`, and styled with
`textCssRule` (rich commented CSS). Animation is two tracks: **CSS** (`@keyframes` + class
applied to the element) and **GSAP** (tween injected into `play()/stop()`).

## edit.ts

Field/definition editing helpers: nextFieldId, addFieldToDefinition, setFieldDefault, …

## cssVars.ts

:root variable read/write helpers (the Style panel's patch layer).

## The Timeline v2 animation-data engine

Data-block templates carry `var NOACG_ANIM = { ... };` (strict JSON inside the braces) plus a
fixed interpreter in the marked ANIMATION region (emitted by
src/templates/shared/animRuntime.ts). These modules are the editor's side of that contract;
editor <-> runtime parity is pinned by e2e/anim-engine.spec.ts.

- **animData.ts** - the schema + the literal's read/write. AnimData = version/root/speed/steps;
  a step = name/duration/ease/reveals?/hides?/calls?/loops?/layers (durations and keyframe times
  are speed-relative: playback divides by `speed`; `reveals` names the layers that FIRST become
  visible in that step, `hides` the layers that LEAVE in it - the early-exit twin, its existence
  span ends there instead of at the final Out; both are explicit data, never inferred from
  keyframes). `loops` is `loops[selector][prop] = { repeat, yoyo?, repeatDelay? }` - a per-track
  loop (GSAP values: repeat -1 = forever, yoyo = breathe back and forth): the interpreter plays
  that track in its own repeating sub-timeline, so an ambient breath lives in the same data as
  every other track (the `layers` arrays are untouched - loops sit beside them). `calls` are
  lifecycle hooks - `{ time, call }` where `call` is a bare identifier
  naming a global template function (a clock engine's `startClock`/`stopClock`); the interpreter
  fires them via `window[name]` at their moment on the step's clock (no eval, ever), and settle
  suppresses them like any GSAP callback (docs/TIMELINE_V2_PLAN.md §3b). A keyframe is
  `{ time, value, ease? }` - value is a number or a string (filter/clipPath interpolate as
  strings); `ease` is the ease INTO the keyframe, defaulting to the step's. `locateAnimData`
  brace-matches respecting JSON strings (a hand-edited block need not match the canonical
  layout); parsing is strict JSON + structural validation - anything off-shape degrades to
  "hand-crafted" honestly, never a crash. `serializeAnimData` is CANONICAL: fixed key order,
  fixed 2-space indentation, keyframes one per line, 3-decimal rounding - a fixed point
  (serialize(parse(serialize(x))) === serialize(x)) so a small visual edit only touches the
  lines it changed. `spliceAnimData` replaces ONLY the object literal; every other character
  of the file (interpreter, user code) is untouched.
- **animEdit.ts** - pure keyframe mutators; every editing surface routes through these, then
  spliceAnimData + one applyTemplate makes the edit real, undoable code. setKeyframe /
  deleteKeyframe (per property), moveLayerKeyframes / deleteLayerKeyframes (the aggregate
  diamond's drag/Delete), setKeyframeEase / setStepEase, and setLayerActivation - the data
  twin of the legacy press chain: moving between presses carries the layer's tuned reveal
  keyframes, entering/leaving the press world writes the channel's default motion; emptied
  presses disappear and default step names renumber. Steps as clips: resizeStep ('preserve'
  keeps keyframe timing - extending leaves settled air, shrinking clamps at the last keyframe
  so motion never silently truncates; 'stretch' = Alt scales times proportionally),
  setLayerHide - the early-exit twin: writes/clears a step's `hides` for a layer (clamped after
  its activation; hiding at Out clears it), driven by the timeline block's RIGHT edge.
  duplicateStep (copies keyframes, NOT reveals or hides; never lands after Out), renameStep,
  deleteStep (layers it revealed return to "appears with ▶ Play" with the channel's default
  motion), addStep (an empty content step just before Out).
- **animEval.ts** - the editor-side playhead resolver, deliberately the ONLY logic duplicated
  from the runtime interpreter (the preview runs the real one): within a step the first
  keyframe holds backward to the step start; between keyframes numbers interpolate LINEARLY
  (the eased in-between is the preview's job - at keyframe times the two agree exactly);
  strings hold the previous keyframe; a step without the track inherits the last keyframe
  value from an earlier step; null = the layer's design (CSS) state. A LOOPING track folds the
  query time back into one pass (loopedTime: GSAP repeat/yoyo/repeatDelay math), so the
  Inspector number tracks the repeating preview. Plus
  stepSeconds/stepOffsets/activationStep/hideStep helpers (hideStep = the step a layer leaves,
  its `hides` step else the final Out).
- **animImport.ts** - the one-time legacy converter: parses a legacy marked region via
  timelineModel's parseTimeline and converts the choreography into AnimData (a `to()`'s from
  values come from the settled DESIGN_STATE table). `parseTimeline` also reads `tl.call(fn)`
  hooks with their resolved positions (parsePhase walks tweens + calls in one document-ordered
  pass; a call never shifts a tween's INDEX, so the legacy patchers are untouched), and the
  importer attaches them to the enter/out step as speed-relative `calls` - this is what lets
  game timers flip to data blocks. It also reads a repeating tween's loop (repeat/yoyo/
  repeatDelay) and writes a step `loop` when the tween's values are finite LITERALS (a breathing
  pulse - this is what lets STARTING SOON flip); a DOM-measured loop (a marquee's `x:-scrollWidth`)
  or a nested-timeline loop (ticker's item flip) fails the phase's `loopsConvertible` gate and the
  whole template stays legacy - tickers/credits are NOT unblocked by loop/yoyo (their travel is
  DOM-measured, a separate gap). Used for read-only rendering of legacy templates on the new
  timeline AND the explicit, undoable convert-on-first-motion-edit; templates the old parser
  cannot read stay hand-crafted - the importer never guesses.
- **presetApply.ts** - presets as keyframe generators DERIVED from their legacy emitters
  through the parity-proven importer (emit the preset's region against a scratch copy of this
  template, convert it, lift out the tracks - one choreography source, zero taste drift).
  Applying a preset is a CLEAN SWAP (ratified): the targeted layer's tracks in that direction's
  step are cleared first, then the donor's are written - switching presets never leaves the
  previous preset's (or a hand-keyed) track behind. The Inspector passes an easing (resolved to
  a GSAP pair, stamped onto the written keyframes so it never disturbs a shared step) and an
  optional per-direction duration (sets the target step's length and scales the donor keyframes
  to fit). 'in' is layer-relative (it targets the step where THAT layer becomes active), 'out'
  always targets the final step, 'both' writes both - independently editable after. Scope 'all'
  = the whole graphic adopting the donor's full choreography and the chosen/donor step duration
  and ease - skipping press-revealed layers, whose entrance belongs to their » press; it also
  swaps the target phase's step `calls` for the donor's (a clock preset carries its
  startClock/stopClock), scaled to the settled duration. Per-layer applies never touch calls -
  they are step-level lifecycle, not layer motion.

## The legacy patchers (animPatch / stepAssign / timelineModel)

These literal patchers still serve the categories that have NOT migrated to the data region
(info cards, starting soon, quiz, credits, tickers, infographics — lower thirds, corner bug,
scoreboards, and game timers create as data blocks), plus every SAVED legacy template until
its owner presses "use keyframes". Deleting them and the classic strip is
Phase 8 of docs/TIMELINE_V2_PLAN.md - deferred by design until the remaining categories
migrate (the blockers per category are documented in src/templates/CLAUDE.md and the plan's
status block).

## animPatch.ts - the marked ANIMATION region

The classic timeline strip only ever touches the marked region
(`/* == ANIMATION … == */ … /* == END ANIMATION == */`) and its three knob variables
(`animSpeed`, `easeIn`, `easeOut`); user code outside the markers is never modified. The
splicers REFUSE a NOACG_ANIM data region (they return the JS unchanged - data templates go
through the engine above).

- `readAnimationInfo` reads per-phase "// In preset:" / "// Out preset:" comments, falling back
  to "// Preset:".
- `swapAnimationPhase(js, id, cfg, 'in'|'out'|'both')` splices two emitted regions at the
  buildOutTimeline boundary - steps code travels with the IN phase.
- Presets are per-category (`presetsForType`); the root prefix is detected via
  model/structure.ts (hyphen-safe). Preset/steps swaps re-emit the region (undoable).
- The steps toggle only shows for line-based categories (lower thirds, info cards, scoreboards,
  corner bug) - continuous, clock, and data-driven formats hide it.

## stepAssign.ts - "appears on press"

`changePartPress` is the ONE appears-on-press transition, shared by the timeline gutter's menu
and the canvas chip. On a data-block template it routes through animEdit's
`setLayerActivation` (plus the SPX steps re-sync), same PressChange shape out. On a legacy
region: entrance->press and press->entrance re-emit the IN phase via `applyStepChain`;
press->press stays the tuning-preserving `patchStepRegroup` literal patch.
Blocks (`data-gfx` + id, OUTSIDE the root) are assignable too - the emitted outside gate hides
them from first paint (steps block, DOM-ready guarded) and `patchOutsideExit` keeps ONE surgical
buildOutTimeline fade line in sync at the animPatch swap choke points, so they leave with the
exit without resetting out-phase tuning.

## timelineModel.ts - the classic timeline's model + patchers

`buildOverview` builds the cue-segmented overview that TimelineView renders (see
src/components/CLAUDE.md), plus the surgical patchers the classic strip edits with:
`splitTween`, `patchTweenTiming`, `patchTweenEase`, `patchStepEase`, `patchTweenVars` /
`insertPartTween` (enters-from), `patchTweenToVars` / `insertPartOutTween` (leaves-to), and
`setObjBlur` (blur's filter-string read/write). Its `parseTimeline` is also the reader
animImport.ts converts legacy regions through.
