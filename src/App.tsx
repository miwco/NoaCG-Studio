 * WHICH SURFACE THIS PAGE LOAD LANDS ON — decided HERE, at module load, before React's first
 * render. main.tsx imports this module and renders immediately after, so "module load" is
 * "before the first frame" by construction, and the answer cannot be confused with a later
 * in-app navigation.
 *
 * THE RULE THIS FILE KEEPS: a boot surface is never chosen from an effect. A plain `useEffect`
 * runs after the first commit has been PAINTED, so the frame it corrects is a frame the reader
 * already saw. A `useLayoutEffect` does run before paint — the routed-wizard effect below
 * depends on exactly that — but it cannot carry a store write, for the reason in the first
 * bullet. Both halves were paid for:
 *
 *   - The wizard used to be opened from an effect. A zustand write made there is scheduled,
 *     not flushed: the store notifies through useSyncExternalStore and React renders the
 *     wizard in a LATER frame, so the first commit painted the studio with no wizard in it.
 *     That is why moving it to useLayoutEffect did not help either — the write still landed a
 *     frame late. Sharing HomePage's `key`, the other attempt, changed what happened AROUND
 *     that frame and never the fact that the wizard did not exist IN it.
 *   - The wizard-first REDIRECT used to be an effect too, and cost the same frame at the
 *     other end: a plain `/app` boot rendered `<AppShell/>` because `''` still parsed as the
 *     editor, painted the whole canvas editor, and only then rewrote the route to Home.
 *     Measured 2026-09-02 on a production build at 4x CPU throttle: one full frame of the
 *     editor, on top, on a boot whose destination was always Home (owner walk 2026-08-28,
 *     "it flashes some other screen underneath... It's very annoying").
 *
 * Deciding here makes the first render the only render there is: `galleryOpen` is already
 * true when the wizard is the answer, and the route already says Home when Home is.
