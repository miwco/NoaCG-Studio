  // ── BOOT RECOVERY (docs/CLOUD_PLAYOUT.md's recovery discipline, local half) ───────────────
  // A browser source that reloads mid-show used to boot at the log HEAD and come back BLANK:
  // off air, every field at the design's own defaults, until an operator happened to press
  // something. Measured on an exported package: a board aired at 89-84 with the clock at 9:55
  // came back invisible, reading 88 and 10:00, with nine rows sitting unread in the log.
  //
  // The log IS the history, so recovery needs no report channel and no new protocol — it needs
  // a BOUNDED replay. Three things bound it, and all three matter:
  //
  //   - it starts at the LAST "play" for this graphic and stream, so what is re-run is the
  //     current airing rather than the whole show. A graphic never played, or stopped since,
  //     is supposed to be blank and is left alone;
  //   - it runs OFF AIR. Replayed commands are ordinary commands and they animate, so a
  //     visible replay would put the outage's history on screen — recovery is never watchable.
  //     The page hides itself, replays, lets the motion settle, and comes back;
  //   - it reads the log ONCE, so every fetch on the way in is retried rather than believed.
  //     A failed read is not a short log and a silent relay is not a missing one — see the
  //     retry discipline below, which is what stops one lost request costing a whole show.
  //
  // The opacity goes on documentElement deliberately: the runtime's own entrance reset clears
  // inline styles across the GRAPHIC's root subtree, which would strip a hide set inside it.
  var SETTLE_MS = 1200;         // an entrance plus an exit; overshooting only costs blank frames
  var MAX_PAGES = 40;           // the tail RPC answers 500 rows at a time — the same ceiling
                                // the hosted renderer's catch-up walk uses

  // ── WHERE THE READ STARTS (the local half's answer to the hosted plane's report baseline) ──
  // The replay above is bounded by the last play; the READ under it was not. It began at row 0
  // every time, and the relay's log is a file that is appended to and never rotated — so that is
  // not "this show", it is every show this package has ever run, up to 20,000 rows fetched 500
  // at a time before the graphic may paint. The hosted plane never pays that: a renderer starts
  // from its own last REPORT and reads only what came after it.
  //
  // There is no report channel here, so this block keeps its own baseline instead, in
  // localStorage on the relay's origin — which is exactly the thing that survives the outage
  // being recovered from, a browser source reloading. It records what has been merged, how far,
  // and which row the current airing began at, and the boot read then starts AT that play.
  //
  // It is a CACHE OF THE LOG and never a substitute for it: whatever it says, every row after
  // the bound is still read and replayed, so a stale baseline costs nothing and a missing one
  // costs only the old full walk. It is versioned because it is persisted (the repo's rule for
  // every stored format): an unknown version is ignored rather than guessed at. So is a baseline
  // whose cursor sits ahead of the relay's head — the log it describes has been reset, and the
  // rows it counted on are gone.
