// CLOCKS ON THE WIRE (docs/CLOUD_PLAYOUT.md §3, docs/SPORTS_PACK.md).
//
// Two halves, one doctrine. The first is the MATCH CLOCK — one clock, started and stopped by the
// operator. The second, at the bottom of this file, is the debate board's pair of SPEAKING
// CLOCKS, which alternate; it reuses every primitive here and adds no new idea, only a second
// shape. What follows is the match clock's story, and it is the story of both.
//
// A match clock is the one piece of a graphic whose truth is a moving number, and a moving
// number cannot be recovered from a snapshot of the commands that moved it. Until 2026-08-19 it
// was not recovered at all: every renderer kept its own counter and incremented it once a
// second, so a browser source RELOADED at 67 minutes came back at 0:00, two renderers started a
// second apart stayed a second apart for the whole match, and a renderer in a background tab
// (Chromium throttles those timers to roughly one a minute) simply fell behind.
//
// THE FIX IS A TIME ORIGIN, and this module is the wire half of it: the clock's value carries
// the instant it was true, appended as `"45:00@1755600000000"`. The template runtime
// (templates/shared/matchClock.ts) paints `value ± elapsed` from that, so
//
//   - two renderers reading the same string paint the same second, whenever they read it;
//   - a re-send is idempotent, which matters because every Take and ✎ Update re-sends the cue's
//     whole value set — a raw counter snapshot pulled the clock backwards on every score bump;
//   - a renderer that boots into the middle of a match derives the right time from the value
//     alone, with no history to replay and no second message to wait for.
//
// **The stamp is DERIVED, never invented.** It is the `clockStart` row's own server time, which
// every renderer sees identically and which a boot-time replay of the log reconstructs exactly —
// so there is no authority to elect and nothing to keep in sync. A locally-authored row (an
// offline production's own commands) has no server time and falls back to the local clock,
// which is correct there because that log has exactly one renderer.
//
// Everything here is pure string work over the PUBLISHED html, so no design has to declare
// anything: the clock element is the one the template contract already names
// (`.<prefix>-clock`), and its field id and count direction are read off it.

 * The rule is the one the runtime already states: what distinguishes a CORRECTION from a resend
 * is that the value the wire carries CHANGED. It is compared against the held value's plain half
 * precisely because the origin write is ours, not the operator's — the operator's `"10:00"` has
 * not changed just because we stamped it.
 *
 * The honest limit, unchanged from the runtime's: an operator cannot re-apply the time the clock

//
// A debate board runs TWO clocks and exactly one of them at a time, so everything above applies
// twice — and the hard part is not the arithmetic, it is "which one is running". That is the
// floor group's pointer, which is MACHINE state, and the wire must not learn to read machine
// graphs to find it.
//
// IT DOES NOT HAVE TO. **The stamp IS the pointer.** The invariant this half keeps is a property
// of the wire's own values, not of any state graph:
//
//     at most one of the two clock fields carries an origin stamp, and that one is running.
//
// From there every verb is arithmetic over a PAIR: `switch` banks the stamped clock as a plain
// time and stamps the other one; with neither stamped it stamps the first, because somebody has
// to open. `penalty` docks whichever clock is stamped. `reset` returns both to the allowance,
// plain. Going off air banks the stamped one. No state id is named here and no edge is read: the
// alternation lives in the two values themselves.
//
// It agrees with the machine because both describe the same two-sided board — the floor group's
// `armed | speakerA | speakerB` under `switch` is the same three-way alternation as
// `neither | a | b` under a moving stamp — and because the DESIGN'S OWN ENGINE
// (`scoreboards/debateFloor.ts`) already decides it that way: `debateStart(side)` holds whoever
// was running and picks the other up from its own number. If that engine ever stops alternating,
// this stops being right, which is why the two are pinned by one spec rather than by a comment.
//
// THE STAMP DOES NOT COME OFF AT ZERO. A speaker who runs out keeps the floor — the engine keeps
// `debateActive` set with the timer stopped — so dropping the stamp there would hand the next
// `switch` to the wrong side. `speakingSecondsAt` floors at zero instead, and a stamped "00:00"
// reads 00:00 however long it is left there.
