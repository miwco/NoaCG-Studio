// GROUPING A CUE'S FIELDS BY WHAT THEY BELONG TO - derived from the template, never authored.
//
// The playout cue editor used to flow every field, in field order, into whatever number of
// columns the window afforded. On a wide monitor a scoreboard therefore read as one long
// undifferentiated row: Team A, Score A, Team B, Score B, Period, Clock, two colours. Owner,
// 2026-08-21: "if we have a scoring system then everything that fits one team should be on one
// row or one column and the other team is in the next row. There would be some logic in how we
// build up the dashboard."
//
// THE CONSTRAINT IS THE SAME OWNER'S NEXT SENTENCE: "we have no idea what kinds of graphics we
// will have in the future… I don't know if we can make any hard rules about this." So this
// module may not know about scoreboards, or about any other type. It reads the SAME side tokens
// `cueData.ts` already reads to load a teams table into one half of a board - if that rule is
// good enough to decide which fields a data row fills, it is good enough to decide which fields
// belong beside each other - and when it is not confident it returns ONE unlabelled group, which
// renders exactly as the flat flow always did. A wrong grouping is worse than no grouping: it
// tells an operator two fields are related when they are not.
//
// docs/PLAYOUT_DASHBOARD.md §2d records the candidates this is the first of.

import { hasSideFields } from './cueData';

// A SECOND VOCABULARY ARRIVED WITH THE SCORE TRACKER (docs/backlog/scoreboard-behaviour.md). The
// owner's ask was "two or more teams", and a board with four of them titles its fields "Team 1",
// "Score 1", "Team 2", … - numbers, not the A/B a match uses. Everything below the token is
// unchanged: the same "does it mirror" test decides, and the same one-unlabelled-group answer is
// what a graphic gets when it does not. Only the alphabet is new.

/**
 * What a band is CALLED on screen.
 *
 * A side band borrows the operator's own word for that side - the value of its first field,
 * which on every two-sided board we ship is the name ("Team A", "Fighter A", "Party A"). That is
 * the whole reason the heading is computed from values rather than from titles: "ARC" and
 * "YLE12" say which half of the board you are editing in the language of the show, where "SIDE
 * A" and "SIDE B" only say that a split exists.
 *
 * It falls back the moment the borrowed word would not help: an empty value, one long enough to be
 * a sentence rather than a name (a heading is a glance, and a wrapped one is worse than a generic
 * one), or A BARE FIGURE. That last one is why the borrowed value is the row's first field rather
 * than a field this module could name: which field comes first is the DESIGNER's document order,
 * and a board that draws its score column before its names hands back `"0"` - a band headed 0
 * while the buttons above it are headed KETUT. A figure is never a name, so it falls through.
 *
 * The fallback is never a guess - `Side A` is exactly as much as we know, and on a numbered board
 * `Row 3` is: a graphic with four teams has no sides, and calling one "Side 3" would be inventing
 * a word for something the titles never said.
