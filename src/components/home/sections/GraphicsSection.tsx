 * The full Graphics section (docs/SAVED_CONTENT_MODEL.md §6): the library with the organisation

 * - ONE HEADER ROW (re-design/handoff.md §5b): title, search, sort, view toggle; then the
 *   TYPE chips, derived from the library so only types someone has appear.
 * - FOLDERS GROUP THE VIEW (owner walk 2026-08-23). Folders come first, then the graphics
 *   filed in none of them; opening a folder shows its contents alone. Until that walk the
 *   folders were a CHIP ROW over a flat list of everything, which the owner overruled after
 *   the first real bulk use — "no point with a folder if I see all the graphics as a list".
 *   They are still the light sorting layer, deliberately not the retired packages: no export
 *   unit, no embedded copies, and a folder is only a name on its graphics.
 * - A SEARCH FLATTENS IT. Typing a name is a question about the whole library, and answering
 *   it with the unfiled graphics alone would be a lie by omission.
 * - MULTI-SELECT: pip + shift-click range over the VISIBLE order, with one bulk bar
 *   (delete, move to folder, add to production, new production from selection). Selection is
 *   UI state over ids; every mutation goes through the model layer's bulk helpers so N rows
 *   cost one storage write.
