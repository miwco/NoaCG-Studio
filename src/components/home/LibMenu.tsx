/**
 * THE ROW POPOVER SHELL — the one place that decides which WAY a `.lib-menu` opens.
 *
 * Every popover on Home hangs off a button inside a scrolling list, and two of them sit at the
 * BOTTOM of the viewport by construction: the bulk bar floats there on purpose
 * (`position: sticky; bottom`, styles.css), and the last row of a long library is there
 * because that is where the list ends. Opening downward from either put the menu off-screen —
 * bulk "+ Production" looked broken while it was in fact adding every graphic (owner walk
 * 2026-08-23: "the pop-up goes underneath my view field").
 *
 * So the direction is MEASURED, never assumed. The menu always renders downward first, this
 * measures what that actually costs against the box it has to fit in (`clipBounds` — the
 * viewport, and any scrolling ancestor that cuts it off sooner), and flips it above the button
 * when it does not fit below and does fit above. The measurement runs in a LAYOUT effect, before
 * paint, so a flipped menu is never briefly drawn in the wrong place.
 *
 * A menu too tall for either side stays below and scrolls inside itself (every `surface` below
 * caps its own height in styles.css) — the alternative, a menu taller than the screen placed
 * "where it fits best", is off-screen at one end whatever we choose.
 *
 * `surface` is the popover's own base class, so this shell is not tied to the library's look:
 * the production dashboard's links panel (`pd-links`) is the same measurement problem wearing a
 * different skin. A surface owes the shell two CSS rules — its own downward offset, and a
 * `<surface>--up` that swaps `top` for `bottom`.
