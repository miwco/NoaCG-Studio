 * clears another layer. That is why `liveCue` is a MAP and why every verb but Take addresses the

            THEY OPEN IN THEIR OWN BROWSER TAB, so Playout never leaves the screen. Owner,
            2026-08-21: "the buttons that we have and the side pages we have feel a bit

            This needed the durable store's CROSS-TAB INVALIDATION first (model/durableStore.ts):
            two tabs on one production used to overwrite each other, so shipping this before that
            would have made the losing path the default rather than an unlucky one.
