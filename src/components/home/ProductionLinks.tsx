/**
 * THE LINKS PANEL of the playout dashboard (docs/PLAYOUT_DASHBOARD.md §7) — publishing and the

 *
 * Everything here is READ-ONLY with respect to the dashboard's own state: it renders what it is
 * given and calls back. The publish / unpublish / claim handlers stay on `ProductionPage`
 * because unpublish clears `liveCue`, and that map is what Take airs — see
 * docs/backlog/production-page-phases.md for why it may not move with the panel.
 */
/**
 * ONE ROW of the links panel: the capability on a single line, its explanation one small arrow
 * away.
 *
 * Every row here used to carry an always-open paragraph, and five of them turned a popover into
 * a page — the control page, the link a class actually operates from, sat below the fold under
 * an explanation of an SPX file most of them will never download. The text is not the problem
 * (an operator reading it once is exactly who it is for); being unable to put it away is. So the
 * help COLLAPSES per row, and a row can be `quiet` — present, findable, but not competing with
 * the links people copy every show.

 * THE ONE BUTTON (docs/CASPARCG_CONNECT.md §2). One `PLAY <channel>-<layer> [HTML] "<output
 * URL>"` is the entire live link: from there every cue, take, update and recovery flows through
 * the durable command log the /output page already follows, which is why there is no per-take
 * CG traffic here.
 *
 * It appears only once a server is configured under Settings -> Playout. Unconfigured, the row
 * would be a dead control on the busiest surface in the app - and the URL row directly above it
 * is the manual route that has always worked and still does.
