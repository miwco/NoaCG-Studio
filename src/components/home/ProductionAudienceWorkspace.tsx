/**
 * The production's AUDIENCE workspace (route `#/production/<id>/audience`, the third tab of the
 * playout dashboard — docs/INTERACTIVE_PLAYOUT_PLAN.md Phase 5).
 *
 * WHAT IT IS: the moderation surface. Viewers send questions and comments; the operator reads
 * them, edits a BROADCAST version without touching what was actually sent, approves or rejects,
 * shortlists, and — the only exit — turns one into an ordinary cue on the rundown.
 *
 * **Nothing here airs anything.** Send to rundown creates a `ShowCue` and stops; the cue is
 * previewed and taken with the same verbs as every other cue. That is enforced by construction
 * rather than by discipline: the audience backend interface has no method that reaches the
 * command log, so there is no path from a viewer's text to Program that does not pass through
 * an operator pressing Take.
 *
 * WHICH PROVIDER IT RUNS ON is decided by one fact: a PUBLISHED production on a build with a
 * backend moderates its real audience through the Supabase provider (the operator's own control
 * slug is the capability); anything else — unpublished, offline build, the e2e suite — runs the
 * in-memory rehearsal provider with its simulator. The surface itself is identical either way,
 * which is what the seam was built for; the one visible difference is that the "simulate
 * arrivals" button exists only where simulating is meaningful.

 * holds straps and bugs too, and staging a tally into a name strap would be worse than saying
 * there is nowhere to put it.
 *
 * The count line and the status are OPTIONAL because they are the fields a board can honestly do
