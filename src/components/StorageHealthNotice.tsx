/**
 * The boot-health notice for a browser where the durable store could not run on IndexedDB
 * (model/durableStore.ts). Degrading was always silent; on locked-down machines (enterprise
 * site-data policies - the class of network the Yle demo failed on) that silence read as
 * "my work vanished". Two honest messages, one per failure shape:
 *
 *  - 'timeout' (a wedged backend): saved documents EXIST in IndexedDB and could not be
 *    loaded, and this session's work lands in localStorage a healthy boot will ignore -
 *    so the user must export anything they want to keep.
 *  - everything else: the browser never offered IndexedDB, so localStorage IS the store,
 *    ceiling and all - saves work until a big graphic does not fit.
 *
 * Health is fixed at boot (the hydration latch), so one read at first render is exact -
 * no subscription needed. Dismissal is session state; the condition returns next load.
