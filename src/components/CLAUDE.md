# src/components - the React app

Loaded alongside the root CLAUDE.md when working in this directory. Keep it accurate. The
store-side halves of these contracts are in src/store/CLAUDE.md; the code patchers they call are
in src/blocks/CLAUDE.md.

## Shell & editor

- **AppShell** - the workspace layout: a flexible DOCKABLE-PANEL model (model/layout.ts). The
  centre is fixed - the canvas (stage + transport) over the timeline, split by a draggable
  divider - and three docks (LEFT, RIGHT, BOTTOM) flank it, each hosting any panels
  (`code`, `inspector`, `data`, `control`, `style`, `ai`, `export`) as tabs. Default: code left,
  Inspector + the tool panels right, timeline roomy in the centre, bottom empty. Each dock renders
  only when it holds panels; the splitters resize the adjacent region. A tab can be MOVED to
  another dock or CLOSED via its ▾ menu; a dock's "+" re-adds any hidden panel (a closed panel
  stays closed across reloads and is offered there). The DockState (panels/active/size) +
  timelineSize persist via model/layout.ts (loadLayout migrates any non-v2 layout to the default).
  The dock component is **WorkspaceDock**; the panel bodies come from AppShell's `renderPanel`
  (the tool panels wrapped in `.panel-body`); MOBILE keeps the fused preview column + SidePanel.
  A NEW selection (any surface) reveals the Inspector - activates its tab, or re-docks it if it
  was closed - DEFERRED half a second past the double-click window: any new pointer press cancels
  the pending reveal and a live canvas gesture (store canvasGestureActive) skips it at fire time,
  so the workspace never resizes between the two clicks of a text double-click or under a drag
  (e2e/inline-edit.spec.ts pins this). The store's `activePanel` is a "reveal this panel" signal
  (the wizard shows Export after an import) - honoured in the docks, but not on mount. The topbar
  ◨/code toggles close-or-reveal those panels. Binds global Ctrl/Cmd+Z to undo() and
  Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+Z (+ Ctrl+Y) to redo() (skipped when focus is in Monaco or a form field).
  useIsMobile/useSplitter support the mobile and resizable layouts.
- **CodeEditor** - Monaco + change-highlight decorations + change dots on inactive tabs the last
  apply touched + hover explanations (the teach/ module registers its tooltips here; there is no
  Learn tab).
- **PreviewFrame** - the stage: the iframe + overlays live in a `.canvas-world` centred in the
  stage and translated by `pan`, scaled by fit × `zoom`. Zoom: the toolbar −/%/+ (the % resets
  to fit), Ctrl/Cmd+wheel (and trackpad pinch) toward the cursor, clamped 0.2–8×. Pan: a plain
  wheel when zoomed in, or a middle-mouse drag (captured before the overlay). Because the overlay
  is sized `stageW × (fit×zoom)` and CanvasInteraction reads its live bounding rect, zoom and pan
  need NO coordinate changes there — the gesture math follows automatically (pinned by the zoom
  case in e2e/multi-select.spec.ts). Off-canvas VISIBILITY (a pasteboard so elements that start
  off-screen render) is a separate step — it needs the iframe to render past the canvas bounds.
- **CanvasGuides**.

## Canvas direct manipulation (Era 6)

- **CanvasInteraction** - always-on direct manipulation: hover cursors; drag the root -> nearest
  zone + residual nudge -> the SAME zoneDecls patch the Style panel writes; dblclick a visible
  #fN -> inline edit -> sample value + definition default via blocks/edit.ts setFieldDefault;
  corner handle -> live --scale preview, diagonal-aware, clamped 0.25-4. Every gesture commits as
  ONE undoable applyTemplate and jumps the editor to the changed tab, highlighted; the root is
  detected via model/structure.ts detectPrefix.
  CANVAS POSITION KEYFRAMING (docs/TIMELINE_INTERACTION_MODEL.md, amendment 3): on a
  data-block template, dragging any SELECTED non-root layer moves the WHOLE selection (layers
  contained in another dragged layer are excluded - the parent's transform carries them) and,
  on release, ONE undoable apply writes each layer's x/y keyframes at the parked playhead -
  the drag itself arms, no Inspector setup. Live GSAP x/y preview while dragging (the same
  animEdit + spliceAnimData path the Inspector edits through, re-parked after the rebuild);
  Escape springs everything back. The root keeps the zone drag, unselected layers don't drag
  on their own, and legacy templates keep the classic gestures exactly. Pinned by
  e2e/canvas-keyframe.spec.ts.
  The SELECTION model (multi, docs/TIMELINE_INTERACTION_MODEL.md): a click selects the
  innermost TemplatePart under the point (registry-driven closest-ancestor hit test,
  rect-containment fallback); clicking the sole selected part again climbs to its container;
  SHIFT-click toggles membership; a drag on EMPTY canvas draws a lasso selecting every
  rendered non-root part it touches (the root is excluded by design); hover previews the
  name; Escape or empty canvas deselects. Selection is editor UI state ONLY - it lives in
  store selectedParts (ordered, first = primary in selectedPart) so the timeline and the
  Inspector track the same elements - never written into the template. Pinned by
  e2e/multi-select.spec.ts.
- **CanvasSelection** - the presentational selection/hover overlay: amber outline + a chip
  speaking part.label - the registry's words, same as the timeline strip. Chips hint only
  actions that already exist: dblclick-to-edit on text lines, corner resize on the root. An
  eligible selected part's chip carries the "appears on press" select - the timeline gutter's
  control from the canvas, same conditions, same blocks/stepAssign.ts patch - and swallows its
  own pointer events so the gesture layer under it never fires.

## Playout & timeline

- **PlayoutSimulator** - owns the running preview timeline `__activeTl`; settles the design view
  after every rebuild (progress(1, true) + a second update()); auto-replays on replayNonce;
  playNext owns each Continue's reveal tween as `__activeTl` step-N. resetGraphic clears GSAP
  inline props on the root subtree before every entrance so a prior exit never leaks its end
  state (e.g. a Blur exit's filter into a Slide entrance that never resets it). Honors the SPX
  `out` = N ms setting by scheduling the exit after the entrance settles + the hold - cancelled
  by any manual play/stop/next/scrub.
- **TimelineDock / StepTimeline** (Timeline v2, both in StepTimeline.tsx) - the dock picks the
  timeline surface per template: a NOACG_ANIM data region gets the clip-style STEP TIMELINE
  outright (the classic strip's literal patchers cannot read it); a legacy region keeps
  TimelineView, with a '⧉ new timeline' peek chip and an undoable '◆ use keyframes' conversion
  (blocks/animImport.ts + the animRuntime writer).
  The step timeline's vocabulary: a time ruler with the operator's cue markers (▶ » ● ■) at
  every boundary; step CLIPS - right-edge resize (default PRESERVES keyframe timing: extending
  leaves settled air, shrinking clamps at the last keyframe; Alt-drag STRETCHES times
  proportionally), context menu Duplicate/Rename/Delete + the step's default ease, »+ adds a
  step, a hold popover edits the SPX `out` setting, a speed select scales everything; LAYER
  ROWS - every registry part gets a row - with aggregate keyframe diamonds, a ▸ caret that
  EXPANDS the layer into per-property sub-rows (each track's own diamonds; drag/Delete/ease
  scoped to that property via moveKeyframe/deleteKeyframe/setKeyframeEase's prop arg), and a
  LAYER STATE BLOCK: the existence span (activation step -> the step it LEAVES: its `hides`
  step, else the end of Out) with the keyframed entering/exiting phases emphasized - its LEFT
  edge drags between step boundaries as the same activation move the gutter/chip make, and its
  RIGHT edge drags to set an EARLY EXIT (blocks/animEdit setLayerHide writes the step's `hides`;
  dragging to Out clears it). Setting a hide on a template whose interpreter predates the
  feature re-emits the whole region so the exit actually plays. KEYFRAME SETS: click selects a diamond, shift-click builds a set,
  dragging any selected diamond moves the WHOLE set (magnetic snap to playhead/step
  edges/other keyframes within ~7px, Alt free, 0.05s grid fallback), Delete clears the set,
  ←/→ nudges it, Ctrl/Cmd+C/V copies and pastes the group at the playhead, Ctrl/Cmd+D
  duplicates it in place. A drag on the empty rows area draws the SAME amber marquee the canvas
  lasso uses (.tlv2-lasso) and boxes every diamond it touches (x -> time, y -> the row bands;
  shift adds; an expanded layer is boxed per-property); the ruler/clips band keeps its scrub.
  A draggable
  playhead with a grab cap + auto-follow scroll and deep zoom (up to 1000 px/s); Space plays
  (never while typing).
  Every edit is a pure data mutation (blocks/animEdit.ts) spliced back by
  blocks/animData.ts - ONE undoable apply each (a group drag/delete/paste chains mutations
  into one apply); playhead/scrub/selection never write history.
  Parity between editor and runtime is pinned by e2e/anim-engine.spec.ts; the interaction
  contract lives in docs/TIMELINE_INTERACTION_MODEL.md.
- **Inspector** (Timeline v2) - the persistent panel RIGHT of the preview and the shared
  selection's third consumer (canvas <-> timeline <-> Inspector): identity + resolved property
  values at the settled state (parseAnimData -> importAnimData -> animEval resolveValue). On a
  data-block template the Properties tab EDITS: each property carries a ◇/◆ diamond - arm it
  to stamp a keyframe at the store playhead, edit an armed value to auto-key there, click a
  diamond sitting ON a keyframe to remove it; ‹ › navigate the layer's keyframes, labels
  drag-scrub the value, blur is the one non-transform (its keyframes live on `filter` as
  'blur(Npx)'), and arming BOTH Position X and Y also unlocks the canvas position-keyframe
  drag (see CanvasInteraction). The Animations tab names which steps move the layer and holds the preset
  picker (preset + In/Out/Both + easing dropdown + per-direction duration + Apply -
  blocks/presetApply.ts); Apply is a CLEAN SWAP of the targeted direction's motion (it never
  blends with the previous preset), and re-parks the preview at the playhead. Legacy templates get a
  read-only shell (the timeline's convert chip arms editing). It is a dockable panel (default:
  the active tab of the RIGHT dock) - shown/hidden/resized/moved like any panel; any NEW
  selection reveals it (activates its tab, or re-docks it if closed - an explicit close holds
  while the selection is unchanged, see AppShell).
- **TimelineView** - the classic collapsible strip under the preview; since Timeline v2 it
  serves LEGACY-REGION categories only (data-block templates get StepTimeline via
  TimelineDock, and lower thirds now create as data blocks). MOMENT CARDS
  `▶In · »1 · »2 · »+Step · ●On air · ■Out` (step cards numbered by PRESS; cue subtitles
  aria-hidden - getByRole('▶ Play') must stay unique in specs) over the CUE-SEGMENTED OVERVIEW
  (blocks/timelineModel.ts buildOverview): ONE strip, all sections side by side, each on its own
  real local clock (widths = duration × zoom; zoom +/- buttons; fit once per template.name), the
  hold a fixed hatched break, registry-part rows spanning every section (multi-target tweens
  expand onto member rows at their stagger offsets; set()-only rows drop).
  Every bar edits in place AND independently: dragging a member of a joint multi-target tween
  SPLITS it per target first (splitTween) so only that layer retimes; bars resize from BOTH
  edges (left = start with the end pinned); dragging any eligible bar across sections moves WHEN
  the part appears (entrance bar -> » press = assign, reveal bar -> entrance = unassign - all
  through stepAssign.changePartPress; section bodies + cards are drop zones; dragged bars get
  pointer-events:none so hit-testing sees through).
  The gutter has each part's "appears on press" menu + the selected moment's ease chips
  (patchTweenEase/patchStepEase). Each part row's ▸ arrow opens the PHASE-AWARE transform
  drawer (X/Y/scale/opacity/rotation + blur): on ▶In it edits ENTERS-FROM (in tween
  from-values settling to identity - patchTweenVars, insertPartTween for partless layers); on
  ■Out it edits LEAVES-TO (out tween to-values - patchTweenToVars, insertPartOutTween;
  opacity never auto-stripped so the exit still fades). Blur is the one non-transform
  (serializes to filter:'blur(Npx)' via setObjBlur). The root never gets a drawer;
  press-assigned parts have none on In but do on Out (leaving is independent of entering).
  THE STRIP IS THE ONE MOTION SURFACE for legacy templates (the Motion side-tab is retired):
  the selected ▶In/■Out card's inspector row holds that phase's preset picker + easing choice
  (swapAnimationPhase / setAnimKnob - phase-correct halves per the easing doctrine; the Out
  card names presets in their exit direction, Blur in -> Blur out), the header holds the
  animSpeed knob, and the selected ●On air card's note edits the SPX `out` setting
  (until-Stop / auto-out N ms / stays - synced into the definition like withStepsSetting).
  ●On air = a pseudo-card (phaseId 'hold'); clicking it parks on the settled look. »+Step
  disables with a tooltip reason. An unparsable marked region gets an honest one-liner PLUS a
  start-over preset select (blank/imported templates get no strip); a 'both' swap re-emits the
  whole region and brings the timeline back. One undoable apply + auto-replay per edit - the
  code always the truth. Row LABELS are the shared-selection handles: clicking one (or a bar,
  without dragging) selects that element on the canvas too (store selectedPart); the selected
  row washes amber.

## Panels (the five tool panels - Data / Control / Style / AI / Export)

On DESKTOP each is a dockable panel (AppShell renders them into the docks; see WorkspaceDock).
**SidePanel** (the five-tab strip) is now the MOBILE surface only. There is no Motion tab: motion
editing lives on the timeline (StepTimeline or TimelineView via TimelineDock) plus the Inspector.

- **SampleDataPanel** - sample values + add-field.
- **ControlPanel** - operator view from the control/ engine; live-drives the preview via
  store.sendControl -> simulator; downloads controlpanel.html; adds the Google-Sheets live-data
  block.
- **StylePanel** - reads/writes the :root style contract (src/templates/CLAUDE.md): colors,
  font swap, zone re-anchoring, post-creation font import.
- **AIPromptPanel**; **ExportPanel** (validation inline; remembers the last-picked target via
  model/prefs.ts). Below the zip targets it mounts **render/RenderPanel** — the Video & image
  section (MP4/WebM/PNG/sequence/ProRes via the render API) — ONLY when `isRenderConfigured()`
  (VITE_RENDER_API): unconfigured builds grow zero render UI, and ProRes/sequence gate on
  `needsSignIn` like AI does. Its measured In/Hold/Out breakdown re-runs when the template or
  sample data changes; job state lives in src/render/renderJobStore.ts (sessionStorage resume).
  Contracts in src/render/CLAUDE.md; specs in e2e/render.spec.ts (stubbed API).
- **PacketManager** (📦 topbar modal), **CommunityGallery** (🌐), **ModerationQueue** (🛡),
  **SyncStatus**, **Homebase** (signed-in dashboard: all saved graphics across packets, one
  store with 📦 Packets), **SettingsDialog** (AI key/model + workflow defaults from
  model/prefs.ts).

## Wizard (wizard/)

CreationWizard (Entry -> Category -> Template -> Fields -> Style -> Animation, persistent live
preview), draft.ts, WizardPreview, MiniPreview, steps/. Creating calls `variant.create(options)`
which generates the complete, commented template.

**Sample data on create:** the wizard applies with
`applyTemplate(template, { resetSampleData: true })` so a new project starts from ITS field
defaults - plain applyTemplate (blocks, panels, AI) intentionally preserves typed sample values
for matching field ids. Don't drop the flag from the wizard path: the old template's values
would leak into the new graphic's fields.

## Auth UI (auth/)

useAuthState hook + authUi store + SignInDialog + SignInPrompt + AuthStatus avatar menu
(-> Homebase / Settings / Sign out). The gating pattern: read `useAuthState().needsSignIn` (true
only when a backend is configured AND the visitor is signed out) and render `SignInPrompt` /
call `useAuthUi().openSignIn(reason)` - never block the app. Signup is OPEN (migration `0006`
made the Before-User-Created hook permissive; restore the 0002 function body to re-close it to
the allowlist). No login wall, ever - see the root CLAUDE.md "Auth posture".
