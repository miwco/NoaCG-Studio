/**
 * THE DOOR TO THE WIZARD - one control, every /app surface.
 *
 * Owner, 2026-08-27: "I don't get there fast enough from other views." Creating was reachable
 * from Home and the editor, one detour away on the control page, and not at all from the
 * production dashboard - so the bar's model (logo = the front page, Home = your work, this =
 * make something) only held on two surfaces out of five. It is one component rather than five
 * buttons because the five had already drifted: the video shell opened the wizard through the
 * store flag instead of the ROUTE (so Back could not close it), and only the editor's went
 * through the unsaved-changes guard.
 *
 * Always routed (`#/new`) and always guarded: a create REPLACES the working document, and
 * requestSwitch is a no-op on a clean one, so the guard costs the common case nothing.
 *
 * `productionId` is the production this open is FOR (the dashboard's own door): the wizard
 * pre-applies that production's look and preselects it on Finish. Standing inside a production,
 * a new graphic that did NOT join it would be the surprise.
 *
 * The WIZARD mounts this door too (owner, 2026-08-28): mid-walk it is a guarded START-OVER -
 * `#/new` rewinds the walk to the front page WITHOUT clearing the draft, so browser Back
 * returns to the step with everything still in it, and nothing is silently lost. On the front
 * page itself the press is a NO-OP, checked here before the guard runs: proceeding would
 * change nothing, so even a dirty document must not raise the unsaved-changes dialog for it.
