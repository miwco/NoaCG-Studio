 * is) and ways to start something new. Broadcast-graphics paths sit together; "Video or
 * animation with AI" is one separated line marked Beta, because it creates a STANDALONE
 * video — not a live broadcast graphic.
 *
 * THREE DIVERGENCES FROM re-design/handoff.md §2a ARE DELIBERATE. They are listed here so
 * nobody "fixes" the screen back towards the picture:
 *  - there is no "Start from a kit" card (see the note at the bottom of this comment);
 *  - a card ACTS ON CLICK; the reference draws radio dots and a Continue button, which is a
 *    second press for a choice that has already been made unambiguously;
 *  - Blank stays behind Advanced mode (docs/GOALS.md "Student release" step 4), so the
 *    default studio shows three cards where the reference shows four.
 *
 * The old per-graphic "Recent" chips are gone deliberately: in the default studio they
 * opened the EDITOR, the demoted surface, and Home's rows (control page, productions,
 * export) are the honest continuation of saved work.
 *
 * "Import graphic" is deliberately its own card and a MANUAL path — no AI anywhere in it.
 * A user who designed their graphic in Photoshop wants NoaCG to make it broadcast-ready
 * (fields, animation, export), not to regenerate it. Existing .html / SPX templates (and
 * logos to design around) go through Create with AI instead.
 *
 * THERE IS NO "Start from a kit" CARD. A kit is not a different way of starting — it is the
 * same walk over a whole set — so "one graphic or the whole kit" is asked at the top of the
 * BROWSE step, where designs are chosen and the answer can be changed without walking back
 * here. (This reverses docs/TEMPLATE_TAXONOMY_PROPOSAL.md §18, 2026-07-23; see the reversal
 * recorded there.)

            THE CONTROLLER ROUTE NAMES ITS MECHANISM, because "run it from the cloud" sounds
            like a platform you have to move onto, and the truth is the opposite: the playout
            client the studio already runs adds ONE browser source and never touches it again.
            That sentence is the answer to "do I have to change my setup", so it says the thing
            the operator actually does rather than where the software lives.

            It says BROWSER SOURCE, never "HTML overlay". `HTML overlay (OBS / vMix)` is the
            name of an export TARGET - a downloadable folder of files - so using the phrase for
            the live URL would make one term mean two products on the one screen. */}

             examples, and a mode nobody has chosen yet does not need examples.

             THE STRIP HAS NO LEADING LABEL. "Not a live graphic?" sat outside the card and
             indented it 160px, so the one row on the step that is not flush with the grid was
             the row already marked as the odd one out — the offset read as a layout fault
             rather than as separation, which the dashed rule above it already provides. The
