/**
 * The wizard's own confirmation dialog — one shape for every moment the wizard stops and
 * states what is about to happen.
 *
 * It exists because of an inconsistency the owner walked into (docs/backlog/
 * playout-handoff-needs-confirming.md): pressing "Export it" opens a window and asks something,
 * while "Add to the production" left the wizard for a rundown chosen in a dropdown he had not
 * checked. Two doors sitting side by side, one ceremonious and one silent, teach the reader
 * that neither is final — so the quiet one is pressed by mistake. This is the ceremony the
 * loud door already had, in the SHARED DIALOG ANATOMY (src/styles/wizard-and-dialogs.css)
 * every other dialog in the product wears: header row with a hard-right ✕, a body, then one
 * footer row with the secondary left and the primary right.
 *
 * The wizard is full-screen, so this renders its own backdrop ABOVE it (`.wz-over`).
 */

/**
 * How many wizard confirmations are on screen. The wizard binds Escape to "rewind a step",
 * and a dialog over it must eat that key rather than share it — both listeners sit on
 * `window`, so stopPropagation cannot separate them. The wizard's own handler was registered
 * first (it opened first), so it runs first, reads this, and stands down.
