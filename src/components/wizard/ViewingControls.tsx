// be watched, and the two size-floor toggles the ratified severity policy names. One shared
// component, because the catalog walk (Style step) and the AI step both offer the same three
// decisions and two copies would drift.
//
// THE SIZE FLOORS ARE ONE TRI-STATE AND ARE DRAWN AS ONE (model/designRules.ts
// LegibilityFloors: 'relaxed' | undefined | 'safe'). They used to be two checkboxes over that
// single value, which is a control that lies about its own shape: ticking "Guaranteed readable
// size" silently changed what "Broadcast text sizes" meant, un-ticking one could not say which
// of the other two states you would land in, and the pair could express a fourth combination
// the model does not have. Three radios say what there is - and each one states what it
// PERMITS, because that is the actual decision: a floor is a rule about what may ship, not a
// feature to switch on.
