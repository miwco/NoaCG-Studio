// Teams - the client half of `docs/TEAMS_PLAN.md` §7 stage 3: create a team, hand out its join
// code, join one, leave one, see who is in it.
//
// WHAT A TEAM IS FOR. Three students with separate accounts prepare and operate the SAME
// production without sharing credentials (TEAMS_PLAN §1). A team owns PRODUCTIONS - never
// libraries. Nothing in this module reads or writes anybody's graphics, assets or settings; the
// verbs here are membership and nothing else.
//
// THE OFFLINE POSTURE IS STRUCTURAL, NOT REMEMBERED. Every function begins at `getSupabase()`,
// which returns null whenever `isBackendConfigured()` is false (backend/config.ts is the ONE
// feature-detection point). So an offline build cannot reach a team verb even if a component
// forgot to gate itself: the call resolves to the empty/refused answer and no Supabase library is
// ever fetched. The UI gate on top of that is `useAuthState()` - see components/teams/.
//
// WHY THE VERBS LOOK ASYMMETRIC (some are table writes, some are RPCs). This mirrors migration
// 0053 exactly, and the asymmetry is the security design rather than an accident:
//   * Creating and renaming a team are ordinary INSERT/UPDATE - the policies say "the row is
//     yours", which a policy can express.
//   * JOINING is an RPC (`team_join`), because "holding the code authorizes this" is not a
//     statement about a column of the row being inserted, and a policy that could read the code
//     would have to admit reading every team's code. `team_members` therefore grants
//     `authenticated` no INSERT and no UPDATE at all.
//   * ROTATING is an RPC (`team_rotate_code`) for the same reason in reverse: it is owner-only,
//     and the refusal is deliberately shaped like a miss so it never confirms a team exists.
//   * LEAVING and REMOVING are one DELETE, because they are one statement to the database - the
//     policy decides which of the two you are doing.
// Reading 0053 before changing anything here is cheaper than rediscovering this.
//
// ERRORS ARE MESSAGES, NEVER THROWS. Every verb answers `{ ..., error: string | null }` the way
// backend/auth.ts does, so a dialog renders a refusal instead of unmounting the app. The database
// is the authority on every one of these refusals; the messages below are the readable half.

import { getSupabase } from './supabase';

/** `teams.name` is `check (length(btrim(name)) between 1 and 80)` in migration 0053. Checked
 *  here too, because the database's refusal arrives as raw PostgREST text - "new row for
