// The sync engine (Era 5.2). Local (localStorage) stays the live read/write path for the editor;
// the cloud is a background MIRROR. runSync() reconciles the two by comparing each record's
// client-controlled updatedAt (both providers derive it the same way, so a pushed record matches
// on both sides and never loops). reconcile() is a pure function — the whole merge policy in one
// testable place; runSync() is the thin impure orchestrator that applies the plan.
//
// Conflict policy: a record changed on BOTH sides since this device last synced is a true conflict
// (concurrent edits). Remote wins as canonical and the local edit is preserved as a
// "(conflicted copy)" — never a silent overwrite, because a user's graphics are irreplaceable.
// Otherwise it's plain last-write-wins by updatedAt. Deletes travel as tombstones (records with
// deleted=true) and win/lose by the same timestamp rule, so a delete propagates instead of the row
// resurrecting.
//
// Fault isolation: every record in the plan is applied independently — one failing put can never
// sink the pass, and the lastSyncedAt bookmark advances whenever the pass RAN TO COMPLETION. A
// frozen bookmark is worse than a failed record: it makes every later local edit look like a
// concurrent-edit conflict, and remote-wins then overwrites fresh work. What the bookmark can no
// longer vouch for is carried per record instead:
//   - pendingPush: keys whose push failed — their local edit never reached the cloud, so they
//     count as locally-changed regardless of the bookmark (a later remote edit is then a true
//     conflict, not a silent remote-wins overwrite).
//   - pendingConflict: keys whose "(conflicted copy)" could not be written — the overwriting pull
//     is skipped and the conflict branch is forced again next pass, until the copy materializes.
// Conflict copies are applied BEFORE the pulls that overwrite their originals, so a crash or
// failure mid-pass can never lose the only copy of a user's work.
//
// Cross-account ids: a local-first record created under a previously signed-in account collides
// with that account's cloud row — the upsert hits the foreign row and RLS denies it, forever.
// Retrying can never succeed, so a denied put (isPutDenied) resolves permanently: the record is
// RE-MINTED under a fresh id locally (the work belongs to whoever is signed in here), the foreign
// id is tombstoned locally, and the new id pushes cleanly. A denied TOMBSTONE deletes nothing of
// ours in the cloud, so it is dropped silently (the 90-day purge removes it locally).
