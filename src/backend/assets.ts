// private `user-assets` Storage bucket (keyed by a content hash, so the same font is stored once per
// user) and replace the inline data with a small reference; on read we DOWNLOAD and restore it.
//
// The LOCAL store always keeps the real data-URLs — sentinels only ever exist in a cloud row — so
// the offline preview/export path is completely unchanged.
