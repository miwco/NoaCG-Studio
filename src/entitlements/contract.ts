// THE ENTITLEMENT CONTRACT - one resolver, one precedence order, one explanation.
//
// PURE MODULE, and deliberately so (the same discipline as the render purity trio in
// src/render/limits.ts): no DOM, no import.meta, no Supabase, no process.env. It is
// imported by the browser (to render the admin page and any "you have reached your
// limit" copy), by api/ (the authoritative check), and by the unit tests. The rows it
// merges are loaded server-side in api/_lib/entitlements.ts; this module only decides
// what those rows MEAN.
//
// Why one module: before this, "what may this user do" was answered in three unrelated
// places - resolveTier(signedIn) for render, ~40 AI_LITE_* environment variables plus an
// AI_LITE_OVERRIDE_USER_IDS list for AI, and nothing at all for storage or projects. An
// admin page that cannot state WHY a user has access is a page that will eventually lie,
// so every resolved value here carries its source.
//
// THE PRECEDENCE ORDER, lowest to highest:
//
//   default plan  <  assigned plan  <  temporary grant  <  manual override
//
// A suspended account short-circuits everything above it: no feature is allowed, whatever
// the plan says. Suspension is an account state, not an entitlement.
//
// THE NEUTRALITY RULE: a numeric limit of `null` means "inherit whatever the server
// already used" - for AI that is the AI_LITE_* environment configuration, for storage and
// projects it means unlimited. The built-in default plan sets every number to null, so an
// instance with no plans table, no assignments and no grants resolves to EXACTLY today's
// behaviour. That equivalence is asserted in contract.test.ts and must stay true: rolling
// out entitlements is not allowed to quietly restrict anyone.
