// THE PERMISSION VOCABULARY - what a CREDENTIAL may do on a user's behalf, beside (not inside)
// the entitlement contract.
//
// PURE MODULE, the same discipline as contract.ts: no DOM, no import.meta, no Supabase, no
// process.env. Imported by api/ (the authoritative check in api/_lib/principal.ts), by the
// browser (the consent card names what it grants) and by the unit tests.
//
// WHY A SECOND VOCABULARY. `FEATURE_KEYS` answers "what may this ACCOUNT do" - it is about the
// account features an entitlement unlocks, and it deliberately excludes the free core. A
// permission answers a different question: "what may THIS CREDENTIAL do of what the account
// may do". A session holds every permission the account has; a scoped agent key (docs/AGENT_CLI.md,
// docs/AGENT_SAVE.md) holds a NAMED SUBSET, and a future OAuth access token will hold whatever
// scopes were consented. So a permission only ever NARROWS: nothing here can grant what the
// entitlement withholds, which is why `permits()` asks both questions and the second one is the
// entitlement's own `allows()`.
//
// ENFORCED vs RESERVED. The same honesty rule as ENFORCED_FEATURE_KEYS: a key is added to
// ENFORCED_PERMISSION_KEYS in the SAME change that adds its call site, never before. The
// reserved keys exist so the consent copy, the admin page and the future verbs (`noacg add`,
// `noacg publish`, live playout) share one vocabulary from day one - and so that
// `playout:operate` is named NOW as the permission no authoring key will ever carry.
