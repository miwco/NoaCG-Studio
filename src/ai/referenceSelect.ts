// Contrast-aware reference selection, shared by the harnesses.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Keyword-matching a reference library returns whatever matched FIRST, so
// the same cards win repeatedly and every generation drifts toward one look. Asking a model
// for "three different directions" in one pass has the same failure: it returns three points
// near one attractor. Diversity has to come from the SELECTION step, deterministically -
// which also costs zero tokens and zero latency, because nothing here calls a model.
//
// It doubles as the legal mitigation: blending several orthogonal references means no single
// source dominates an output (docs/BROADCAST_DESIGN_SYSTEM_RESEARCH.md §7.4). The variety
// mechanism and the trade-dress mitigation are the same mechanism.

/**
 * A/B switch for the PoC. Three arms, not two, and the third one is the point.
 *
 *  - `contrast`  the feature: strongest-match anchor, then a max-min contrasting companion.
 *  - `padded`    THE CONTROL. The keyword pick's choice rule - declaration order, no contrast,
 *                no recency - but always widened to two cards from the same genre-compatible
 *                field `contrast` draws from.
 *  - `legacy`    what shipped: `filter(...).slice(0, 2)`, byte for byte.
 *
 * `legacy` is NOT a usable control, which is why `padded` exists. A brief matching one card is
 * handed ONE card by the keyword pick, while contrast anchors one and always widens to two - so
 * the two arms differ in how much reference prose is injected, not only in which cards. On the
 * bench bank that is 9 of 21 generations. A gallery win measured against `legacy` could then be
 * explained by "two cards of design DNA beat one", which costs a one-line change rather than the
 * whole contrast mechanism. Benching `contrast` against `padded` holds the dosage constant and
 * leaves only the choice of companion varying, which is the thing under test.
 *
 * See docs/BROADCAST_DESIGN_SYSTEM_RESEARCH.md §8.3f and scripts/reference-select-simulate.mjs.
 * Typed wide so every branch stays live for the compiler.
 *
 * SHIPPING ON `legacy`, DELIBERATELY - do not flip this to run an experiment and forget it.
 * `contrast` is measured but not justified: it concentrates 62% of companion slots onto two
 * cards no brief ever matches, and the free proxy that appeared to endorse it is maximised by
 * exactly that concentration (§8.3f). The paid pass (§8.3h) withdrew the claim that the
 * concentration produces visibly WRONG output, but it vindicated nothing - the Motion Director
 * filtered the companion out entirely, so what it measured was the Director, not the cards.
 * `padded` is untested for output quality in either direction. The part of this work that
 * earned its place is the reference POOL (6 cards -> 14), which every arm benefits from.
 * Flipping this line changes what every user's video generation is prompted with.

 * banning it. Plain argmax-distance has no notion of what OTHER calls chose, so whichever card
 * sits furthest out on the axes wins the companion slot almost every time - measured: the single
 * card at a unique axis position took 9 of 33 companion slots. A continuous penalty rotates that
