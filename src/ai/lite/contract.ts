   * It was `textCapacity: 'medium' | 'high'` until 2026-08-07, and the word was wrong in the
   * direction that matters: both designs calling themselves `medium` measured widest (lt15 at
   * 66), while the one calling itself `high` loudest held the fewest of all six (lt32 at 28).
   * The model chose a chassis on that word, so a long job title went to the two tightest
   * designs and wrapped onto three lines in the first production round - and no gate could see
   * it, because a wrapped line does not escape its frame.
   *
   * The cause is that these designs set their supporting line in TRACKED UPPERCASE in their own
   * CSS, which costs roughly a third of the characters a reader expects. That is invisible in
   * the source and obvious in the render, which is why this number comes from
   * `scripts/lite-line-capacity.mjs --check` and is gated against it.

   * field was an adjective and it ranked the designs almost backwards.
   *
   * Null when the chassis carries no slot. The two halves are split because they go stale
   * differently:
   *
   * - `fits` is GEOMETRY - which mark shapes land at a legible size with their clear space
   *   intact. It is a fact about the slot and no palette changes it. A shape absent here is one
   *   the design crushes: measured 2026-08-09, a square well reduced a 4:1 wordmark to a 20px
   *   strip and a 10:1 rail to about 8px, and no gate in the tree could see it because a
   *   letterboxed image does not escape its frame.
   * - `surface` is TONE, and it is one word because one word is all that is true. `palette`
   *   means the slot sits on the design's own panel, so the user's package decides whether a
   *   dark-ink or a knockout mark reads. `dark` means the slot sits on the PICTURE - a
   *   panel-less design is welded to a dark backdrop (docs/CATALOG_VARIETY.md §5.3), so a
   *   brand that only has a dark version of its mark cannot use this chassis at all.

/**
 * `intentKinds` is a hand-authored fit claim, and it is capable of being WRONG in the direction
 * that refuses work - which is how `call-to-action` failed every round from 2026-08-08's gateway
 * round onwards, five of five.
 *
 * The mechanism: `intentMatchesRoles` forces `kind: 'promotion'` for any `call-to-action` or
 * `social-handle` line, and `promotion` was listed by exactly ONE of the six chassis - `lt05`,
 * whose own digest entry reads "forward-leaning condensed sport slab", `bestFor` sports and
 * high-energy segments. The fixture asks for "a concise programme lower third … confident and
 * useful, not salesy". Every taste signal in the digest points away from lt05 and the intent
 * constraint pointed only at it, so the model chose on taste and the server refused it
 * `intent_variant_mismatch`, twice, and returned `generation_failed`. **The contract and the fit
 * metadata pointed in opposite directions, and the contract won by refusing.**
 *
 * A restrained call to action over a programme strap is ordinary broadcast work, so four more
 * designs now declare it. `lt32` Scrim deliberately does not: it holds 28 characters on its
 * supporting line, the tightest of the six, and a call to action plus a URL is the longest copy
 * pair Lite is asked for - a capacity reason, not a taste one.
 *
 * The structural guard is in `api/_lib/aiLite.test.ts`: **no intent kind may be servable by only
 * one chassis.** An intent with a single home is a brief that can only be answered by one design,
 * whatever the design looks like - and this profile has now shipped that twice, counting
 * `textCapacity`'s adjectives (docs/AI_LITE_PLAN.md §1).
 *
 * That guard found the SECOND instance the moment it was written: `team` was also lt05-only. It
 * failed less loudly because `intentMatchesRoles` lets a `team-name` line take `kind: 'person'`
 * as well, and `person` is on every chassis - so `team-identity` came back intermittently rather
 * than never, which is exactly the signature that gets written off as sampling. `call-to-action`
 * and `social-handle` map to `promotion` ALONE and had no such escape hatch. A club name over a
 * competition kicker is as ordinary as the call to action, so the same four designs declare it.

    // strap can hold: 7 of 12 neon rows were marked down for a missing "eighties horizon",
    // and ALL 12 landed at briefFit 1-3 (§6e). A horizon is a scene element, and the

    // this axis or strapShape. Score the CHARACTER at strap scale, never the noun list.
    '- briefFit: does the treatment deliver the requested style at STRAP SCALE? A brief describes a mood in whatever words suit it, and some of those name things a lower third cannot hold - a horizon, a landscape, a poster, a full scene, vast negative space. Read those as direction for colour, type, texture, and edge, and score whether the strap carries that character; never mark a graphic down for lacking a scene element that could not fit on a strap in the first place. A committed treatment shows a palette and typeface chosen for the style rather than defaults, shape and edge treatment belonging to it, and decoration that reads as intentional. Score 1-2 for a plain default panel that could have served any brief. Score 5 when the strap would still be recognisable as that style with its text removed.',

    // rewrite asks for the same inspection textIntegrity does: find the elements first, ask
    // what binds them, and let absence be the FIRST failure rather than an unlisted one.
    //
    // The SCALE clause is the second correction, and it settles a contradiction between two
    // of our own prompts: the generation prompt tells the model a strap's "width [is] set by
    // the text plus steady padding" (and the catalog sizes with fit-content), then this axis
    // scored two text-hugging straps 2 for being "a small box rather than a lower-third
    // strap" - punishing exactly the rule the generator was given. Judge the band's OWN
    // proportions, never its share of the frame.
    '- strapShape: judge the graphic as SHAPE before you read it. Locate every painted element - panel, bar, rule, scrim, text block, mark - and ask what holds them together. Score 1 when nothing does: text sitting on bare video with no panel, bar, rule, or scrim behind or beneath it, or any element stranded across a gap of empty video from the rest of the composition. Sitting low in the frame does not by itself make a lower third. Judge the band by its OWN proportions, not by how much of the frame it fills: a lower third is sized by its text plus padding, so one spanning only a quarter or a third of the frame width is normal broadcast practice and must NOT be marked down for it. A two-line strap over short text is naturally only about two and a half times wider than tall - that is a strap, not a box. Score 1-2 only for a form approaching square or taller than wide, a tall stack, a centered plate, or one covering most of the frame. Score 5 for a single low, horizontal band, clearly wider than tall, whose parts visibly belong together - whatever its width on screen.',

  // ── The capacity repair ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  //
  // A chassis whose measured capacity cannot hold the lines the model emitted used to be a
  // refusal, and the volume matrix measured what that costs: five of five academic briefs died
  // `line_count_invalid` at attempt two, on every mark and every palette, because the design
  // that best MATCHES an academic credit (ls17 Lectern) declares a minimum of three lines and
  // the brief carries two (`benchmarks/lite/MATRIX-2026-08-13.md`). The repair round cannot save
  // it: the model re-picks on taste and lands on the same design again.
  //
  // So the platform re-picks instead, exactly like the mark repair one screen down and the
  // palette repair below it - a rule that turns a bad graphic into NO graphic is worse than the
  // defect it replaces. The chosen replacement must be legal in every dimension the original was
  // being judged on, or this trades one failure for another (the lesson the mark repair records
  // about moving a knockout mark onto a design with no reading surface):
  //
  //   · same category and aiCategory, so the checks below still mean what they say;
  //   · measured capacity that HOLDS the emitted line count;
  //   · the emitted intent kind, so `intent_variant_mismatch` cannot fire on the replacement;
  //   · every emitted role accepted by the slot at its own index, so the swap cannot land as
  //     `slot_role_mismatch`;
  //   · room for the copy the model actually WROTE. Comparing the two chassis's
  //     `supportingLineChars` instead - the mark repair's test - makes this repair impossible
  //     exactly where it is needed: ls17 declares the largest capacity in the bank (134, because
  //     an academic position runs long), so nothing in the catalog would ever qualify. The
  //     measured number describes the supporting line, so ask it about the supporting lines in
  //     hand;
  //   · and, when the request carries a mark the spec asked to use, a slot that fits that mark's
  //     shape - a re-pick that drops the user's logo is not a repair.
