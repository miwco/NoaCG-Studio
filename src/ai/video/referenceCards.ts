// Design DNA reference cards: compact craft vocabularies injected into the Motion Director's
// prompt as INSPIRATION - never the answer. The injection text requires an ORIGINAL design;
// the brief always outranks the reference.
//
// Two provenance families live here:
//   - the first six are distilled from NoaCG's own shipped SPX template families
//     (docs/DESIGN_LANGUAGE.md §8 tokens + the catalog's signature reveals);
//   - the rest are abstracted BROADCAST CONVENTIONS - genre and regional design languages
//     observed across many packages, written from scratch for this file.
//
// LEGAL CONTRACT (docs/BROADCAST_DESIGN_SYSTEM_RESEARCH.md §6.1, §7.3-7.4). Cards store no
// images and no copied prose, and no card may name a real network, studio or package as a
// thing to imitate - a card describes a GENRE, never a work. `provenance.sources` is for a
// human to verify against; it is never fetched and never reaches a model. Only `card` text
// is sent. The surviving legal claims in this area are trademark, not copyright, so the
// brand-blind boundary between `provenance` and everything else is load-bearing.
//
// `axes` drives contrast selection (referenceSelect.ts) and is NOT sent to the model.

systematic, often coded by section - and gradients are actively avoided; white is a colour,
not a background. The graphic occupies its own zone BESIDE the picture, never marking it up.
Motion is slow, singular and physical: one transform per beat, 400-800ms, symmetric easing,
and NO overshoot anywhere. Nothing on screen shouts louder than anything else.`,

mid-sentence for emphasis), and every glyph survives over arbitrary video via heavy outlining
- frequently a double outline plus a drop shadow - rather than via a panel behind it. Text is
word-synchronous: it pops in on-frame with the beat, hard cut, no ease. Colour is a legend

numeral size. The graphic STRUCTURALLY shrinks the picture - an L-shaped or wrapped band takes
two or three edges and the video keeps only 70-80% of the frame. Palette is deliberately
narrow (blacks, greys, one blue) with saturated hues RESERVED as state indicators so they
never appear decoratively; carry state redundantly with an arrow or triangle as well as
colour. Motion is continuous rather than event-based: a steady crawl, and a value updating by
flashing its cell for a few frames then decaying back. Restraint reads as seriousness here.`,

carry ladders, wheels and timers. Type is the largest on television - it reads on a phone and

locked, correct and incorrect are distinct designed states, not restyled variants. Bloom,
bevel and volumetric light remain legitimate here where they were abandoned elsewhere - a flat

compact technical face for the stat layer set far smaller than any traditional sport would
accept, because the audience reads it at a glance. SIDE colour is structural and outranks brand
colour. The chassis is dark and semi-transparent so it composites over a bright render, with
accent glows carrying state. Geometry is chamfered and bracketed - corner ticks, angled cuts,
1px grid or scanline texture. Motion is the fastest anywhere: 4-10 frame builds, sub-elements
arriving 1-2 frames apart. Elements BREATHE at rest - idle pulses and drifting textures - which

crop deliberately at the frame edge - set in one geometric or grotesque family, tightly tracked,

scale, alignment and negative space alone. Motion is the CUT - frames replace each other on the
