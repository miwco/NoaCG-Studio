export const MOTION_PRINCIPLES = `## NoaCG motion-design principles (the permanent quality bar)
- Clear visual hierarchy: one hero element; everything else supports it. If everything is
  big, nothing is.
- Purposeful movement: every animation exists to direct attention or express energy - no
  decoration-only motion. If removing a movement changes nothing, remove it.
- Excellent typography: deliberate size CONTRAST (hero type 3-6x support type), tight
  letter-spacing on large text, generous on small caps labels. System font stacks are fine
  when chosen well (e.g. 'Arial Black', Helvetica for impact; Georgia for editorial).
- Readability first: text holds still long enough to read (≥ 18 frames for a short line),
  strong contrast against what it actually sits on.
- Professional easing: springs and clamped interpolate curves with intent - decisive
  entrances (fast start, soft landing), sharp exits (accelerate away). NEVER linear for an
  entrance or exit; linear only for continuous travel.
- Intentional timing: choreograph on a beat grid; stagger related elements 2-5 frames.
- Decisive entrances and exits: the piece starts with confidence and ENDS CLEANLY - by the
  last frame everything has exited or settled deliberately (no mid-motion freeze).
- Restraint: 1-2 typefaces, one accent color doing sharp small work, black/white/greys
  doing the heavy lifting. Fewer, better-choreographed elements over busy scenes.
- Broadcast polish: subtle depth (soft shadows, layered darks), no default-blue, no pure
  #FF0000, no rainbow gradients.
- Compose for the WHOLE frame: the hero occupies a confident share of it (a title spans
  roughly half the width; a full-frame piece like a stinger covers the frame at its peak).
  Never a small element adrift in empty space - if it reads as under-scale, it is. Use the
  frame's own width/height fractions to size things.
- No placeholder design, ever. These are the signs of an unfinished result, and none may
  ship: a flat grey/neutral rectangle standing in for real content; the literal word
  "LOGO"/"TEXT" as a stand-in; a lone element doing a weak center-screen fade with no
  structure; arbitrary drift that isn't choreographed; a thin washed-out gradient. If an
  intended element (a logo image) is absent, design a real substitute - see the contract.`;

export const REMOTION_CONTRACT = `## The composition contract (hard requirements - the validator enforces these)
- ONE complete TSX module. Imports ONLY from 'react' and 'remotion'. Default-export the
  composition component. No other files exist.
- Everything derives from useCurrentFrame() and useVideoConfig(). The same frame ALWAYS
  renders the same image (scrubbing, replay, and the final render depend on it).
- Read duration/fps/size from useVideoConfig() - NEVER hardcode them. Scale layout to the
  frame: compute sizes from width/height fractions where it matters.
- Animate with interpolate() (ALWAYS pass extrapolateLeft/Right: 'clamp' unless the value
  must keep traveling) and spring({ frame, fps, config }). Structure phases with
  <Sequence from={...} durationInFrames={...}> where it clarifies the timeline.
- Randomness ONLY via remotion's random(seed) with a stable string seed - NEVER
  Math.random. No Date.now, no timers (setTimeout/setInterval/requestAnimationFrame), no
  fetch/network, no window/document/globalThis access, no useState for animation.
- The component receives TWO props: \`{ assets = {}, fields = {} }: { assets?:
  Record<string, string>; fields?: Record<string, string | number> }\`. \`assets\` maps
  logical asset names to URLs; use <Img src={assets['name']}/> from remotion for images and
  <Video src={assets['name']}/> for video assets - NEVER OffthreadVideo (asset URLs are
  data/blob URLs, which its frame extractor cannot read). NEVER invent URLs or file paths;
  only use the asset names you were given. \`fields\` carries the editable inputs (below).
- Missing assets are the common case (the brief may name a "logo" with none uploaded). When
  an expected image is absent, design a REAL substitute, never a placeholder: for a logo or
  brand reveal, set a typographic WORDMARK (bold, tight-tracked, uppercase - a designed
  logotype), the same hero the image would have been. Under NO circumstances render a grey
  box or the literal text "LOGO". Only branch to <Img> when the named asset actually exists.
- EDITABLE INPUTS (the video Template Definition): expose the content a non-technical user
  would want to change - the headline/title text, a subtitle or kicker, an accent colour, a
  score or a count - as \`fields\` the module reads, and DECLARE each in the emit tool's
  \`inputs\` array. Read every one with a fallback that equals its declared default:
  \`const headline = fields.headline ?? 'PRIME TIME';\` and
  \`const accent = String(fields.accent ?? '#f6a623');\`. The module MUST still render with
  no fields (the fallbacks). Expose only REAL content choices (typically 2-5); keep timing,
  layout, and animation constants in code - not every value becomes an input. Use types:
  text (copy), number (a score/count, with min/max), color (a hex accent), select (a small
  set of choices). Declare [] only when the piece truly has no editable content.
- Transparent projects: the root <AbsoluteFill> paints NO background. Opaque projects:
  paint a deliberate background (a designed dark gradient beats flat black).
- Write clean, readable code a motion designer can edit: descriptive names, short comments
  explaining the WHY of each phase, timing constants gathered near the top. No cleverness,
  no premature abstraction.
- Keep it self-contained and under ~300 lines.`;
