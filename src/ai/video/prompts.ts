export const MOTION_PRINCIPLES = `## NoaCG motion-design principles (the permanent quality bar)
- A COMMITTED CONCEPT: every piece is built around ONE memorable device you could name in
  a sentence ("the title assembles from sliced slabs", "a gold ribbon carries the
  reveal", "steam curls rise into the wordmark"). Choose it deliberately and let every
  element serve it. A technically clean result that reads as a neutral default template
  is a FAILURE of this bar - design something this brief, and only this brief, deserves.
- Clear visual hierarchy: one hero element; everything else supports it. If everything is
  big, nothing is.
- Purposeful movement: every animation exists to direct attention or express energy - no
  decoration-only motion. If removing a movement changes nothing, remove it.
- Excellent typography: deliberate size CONTRAST (hero type 3-6x support type), tight
  letter-spacing on large text, generous on small caps labels. Prefer the BUNDLED broadcast
  faces (listed in the contract) for hero type - the right face is the biggest single lever
  on a premium look. A well-chosen system stack is still fine where nothing bundled fits
  (e.g. Georgia / 'Times New Roman' for a serif/editorial look, since the bundled set is
  sans/display/mono). Size EVERY piece of type from the frame (fractions of height/width),
  never a fixed px value - a support/kicker line is around height*0.025-0.035; a hardcoded
  22px kicker on a 1080p canvas is unreadably small.
- SIZE THE HERO FROM ITS OWN STRING, never from a height fraction. Each bundled face lists
  its measured width per uppercase character (the contract's font list); a height fraction
  knows nothing about how long the title is or how wide the face runs, which is why it
  fails in BOTH directions - long strings in a wide face overflow, short strings in a
  narrow face come out timid.
  Work it out explicitly, in this order:
    charWidth = fontSize * capAdvance(face)     // capAdvance is given per face
    lineWidth = charWidth * characters          // include the spaces
  Choose fontSize so the settled hero line spans 55-80% of the frame width - that is a
  FLOOR as much as a ceiling - and never more than 88%. A 4-character word therefore takes
  a far larger fontSize than a 14-character one, in the same design.
  VERY SHORT HEROES ARE THE EXCEPTION: at roughly three characters or fewer - a countdown
  numeral, a monogram, "GO" - the width band stops meaning anything (one digit would demand
  an absurd size to span half the frame), so HEIGHT governs instead: set such a hero to
  about 35-60% of the frame height and let its width fall where it falls. The point of both
  rules is the same - a hero that owns the frame - so never read the width band as licence
  to shrink a single numeral until it spans 55%, and never let a short hero sit small just
  because the arithmetic was written for words.
  Then CHECK the result: at the settled moment no readable text may cross the frame edge or
  clip against an overflow mask. A line set with white-space: nowrap has no safety net -
  it will not wrap, it will simply run off the frame - so it must be sized to fit outright.
- Readability first: text holds still long enough to read (≥ 18 frames for a short line),
  strong contrast against what it actually sits on.
- Professional easing: springs and clamped interpolate curves with intent - decisive
  entrances (fast start, soft landing), sharp exits (accelerate away). NEVER linear for an
  entrance or exit; linear only for continuous travel. When a bezier is the right tool reach
  for a STRONG curve, never a built-in default: entrances land well on
  Easing.bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1), on-screen moves on (0.77, 0, 0.175, 1). An exit is the
  mirror of an entrance, not a repeat of it - it accelerates away rather than easing out.
- Intentional timing: choreograph on a beat grid; stagger related elements 2-5 frames.
- Decisive entrances and exits: the piece starts with confidence and ENDS CLEANLY - by the
  last frame everything has exited or settled deliberately (no mid-motion freeze).
- Nothing appears from nothing: never scale from 0. Start at scale 0.9-0.97 with opacity, or
  travel in from off-frame - an element that materialises out of nowhere reads as an effect,
  not an object. Overshoot is EARNED: bounce only where something visibly carried momentum
  into frame (a slam, a throw, a fast slide). A panel that simply faded up must not overshoot.
- Motion has an origin and a direction, and both are earned: an element leaves the way it came
  (in from the right, out to the right - never in-right/out-down), and it grows from the thing
  it belongs to (a stat from its bar, a title from the edge its accent entered) rather than
  from a defaulted centre.
- Frame-level smoothness: keep the per-frame positional change small enough that fast travel
  reads as movement rather than strobing - a shape crossing the frame in 6 frames stutters.
  If a move must be that fast, carry it with motion blur or a stretch. Blur also bridges a
  crossfade: two states dissolving sharply read as two objects swapping, where a few px of
  blur through the midpoint reads as one thing transforming. The render is offline, so blur
  costs nothing here in the way it would in a live browser.
- THE BRIEF PICKS THE PALETTE WORLD: audience, genre, and energy decide whether the piece
  lives in layered darks, daylight warmth, rich saturated colour, or airy light tones - a
  warm morning look executed with depth is exactly as premium as a graphite newsroom.
  Within the chosen world keep discipline: neutrals carry the frame, one or two accents do
  sharp work. No rainbow/multi-hue gradients (tonal SAME-HUE shading is the depth tool),
  no default-blue, no pure #FF0000.
- Restraint in COUNT, not in character: 1-2 typefaces and few, well-choreographed
  elements - but give each one material character (a lit surface, a texture, a strong
  silhouette). Minimal is a design choice; empty is not.
- No flat colour walls: any shape covering a large share of the frame is a LIT surface -
  give it a soft same-hue gradient, an edge highlight or hairline keyline where it meets
  another layer, and a shadow separating it from what is behind. Overlapping panels stay
  individually readable (distinct tones, visible edges); if the layers collapse into one
  flat fill, the depth is gone and the piece reads cheap.
- Deliberate stacking, text on top: paint back-to-front - background, then shape layers,
  then text/logo LAST in the JSX (explicit zIndex when in doubt). Once a text element has
  landed and is readable, nothing sweeps over or covers it: a covering wipe happens BEFORE
  the text lands, and text exits BEFORE (or with) the panels under it, never after.
- Compose for the WHOLE frame: the hero occupies a confident share of it (a title spans
  roughly half the width; a full-frame piece like a stinger covers the frame at its peak).
  Never a small element adrift in empty space - if it reads as under-scale, it is. Use the
  frame's own width/height fractions to size things.
- No placeholder design, ever. These are the signs of an unfinished result, and none may
  ship: a flat grey/neutral rectangle standing in for real content; the literal word
  "LOGO"/"TEXT" as a stand-in; a lone element doing a weak center-screen fade with no
  structure; arbitrary drift that isn't choreographed; a thin washed-out gradient - and
  the uncommitted default: a centred word on a plain dark radial gradient with a light
  sweep and a small-caps kicker. That last one is this tool's most common failure; it
  only passes when the brief asks for exactly that. If an intended element (a logo image)
  is absent, design a real substitute - see the contract.`;

export const REMOTION_CONTRACT = `## The composition contract (hard requirements - the validator enforces these)
- ONE complete TSX module. Imports ONLY from 'react' and 'remotion'. Default-export the
  composition component. No other files exist.
- Everything derives from useCurrentFrame() and useVideoConfig(). The same frame ALWAYS
  renders the same image (scrubbing, replay, and the final render depend on it).
- Read duration/fps/size from useVideoConfig() - NEVER hardcode them. Scale layout to the
  frame: compute sizes from width/height fractions where it matters.
- Animate with interpolate() (ALWAYS pass extrapolateLeft/Right: 'clamp' unless the value
  must keep traveling) and spring({ frame, fps, config }). Structure phases with
  <Sequence from={...} durationInFrames={...}> where it clarifies the timeline.
- Randomness ONLY via remotion's random(seed) with a stable string seed - NEVER
  Math.random. No Date.now, no timers (setTimeout/setInterval/requestAnimationFrame), no
  fetch/network, no window/document/globalThis access, no useState for animation.
- The component receives TWO props: \`{ assets = {}, fields = {} }: { assets?:
  Record<string, string>; fields?: Record<string, string | number> }\`. \`assets\` maps
  logical asset names to URLs; use <Img src={assets['name']}/> from remotion for images and
  <Video src={assets['name']}/> for video assets - NEVER OffthreadVideo (asset URLs are
  data/blob URLs, which its frame extractor cannot read). NEVER invent URLs or file paths;
  only use the asset names you were given. \`fields\` carries the editable inputs (below).
- Missing assets are the common case (the brief may name a "logo" with none uploaded). When
  an expected image is absent, design a REAL substitute, never a placeholder: for a logo or
  brand reveal, set a typographic WORDMARK (bold, tight-tracked, uppercase - a designed
  logotype), the same hero the image would have been. Under NO circumstances render a grey
  box or the literal text "LOGO". Only branch to <Img> when the named asset actually exists.
- EDITABLE INPUTS (the video Template Definition): expose the content a non-technical user
  would want to change - the headline/title text, a subtitle or kicker, an accent colour, a
  score or a count - as \`fields\` the module reads, and DECLARE each in the emit tool's
  \`inputs\` array. Read every one with a fallback that equals its declared default:
  \`const headline = fields.headline ?? 'PRIME TIME';\` and
  \`const accent = String(fields.accent ?? '#f6a623');\`. The module MUST still render with
  no fields (the fallbacks). Expose only REAL content choices (typically 2-5); keep timing,
  layout, and animation constants in code - not every value becomes an input. Use types:
  text (copy), number (a score/count, with min/max), color (a hex accent), select (a small
  set of choices), image (which uploaded asset fills a slot). Declare [] only when the piece
  truly has no editable content.
- IMAGE INPUTS let the operator choose WHICH uploaded asset fills a slot (a logo, a
  background) without code. The field value is an asset's LOGICAL NAME, so read it against
  the assets prop and branch on presence exactly like a directly-named asset:
  \`const logoName = String(fields.logo ?? '');\` then
  \`const logo = assets[logoName] || assets['knownName'];\` then
  \`{logo ? <Img src={logo} .../> : <a designed wordmark/>}\`. The declared \`default\` is a
  known asset name when one is uploaded, else \`''\`. NEVER put a URL or file data in the
  field value - the URL always comes from the assets prop. Only declare an image input when a
  real image slot exists; the "missing image -> designed substitute" rule above still applies.
- Transparent projects: the root <AbsoluteFill> paints NO background. Opaque projects:
  paint a deliberate background (a designed dark gradient beats flat black).
- BUNDLED FONTS - these broadcast faces are already loaded in BOTH the preview and the
  final render; use one by writing its family name in fontFamily (with a fallback), e.g.
  \`fontFamily: '"Bebas Neue", "Arial Narrow", Arial, sans-serif'\`. Available:
${videoFontFamiliesDoc()}
  Do NOT @font-face, import, link, or fetch a font - they are pre-injected, and any
  network/URL font load is rejected by the validator. A system stack (Arial, Georgia, …)
  is allowed where none of the above fits (there is no bundled serif).
- Write clean, readable code a motion designer can edit: descriptive names, short comments
  explaining the WHY of each phase, timing constants gathered near the top. No cleverness,
  no premature abstraction.
- Keep it self-contained and under ~300 lines.`;
