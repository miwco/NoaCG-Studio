// THE TASTE instrument - the owner's own six composition rules, as measurements of a RENDERED
// frame (memory: owner-taste-rules-composition; docs/NOACG_PRO_PLAN.md §15, §17).
//
// BENCH-ONLY (see exemplars.ts for the deletion condition).
//
// WHY IT EXISTS. On 2026-08-19 the owner read four galleries - 36 blind package rows and two
// topic-card sets - and across roughly sixty individual comments named the SAME small set of
// faults: a mark not centred in the square it sits in (ten of thirty-six rows, the single
// most-repeated complaint in the corpus), secondary text "unacceptably small", text "too thin"
// and "grey on black … unreadable", a mark eating the card's primary real estate, and a package
// carrying its wordmark on two pieces of three. Every one of those is a NUMBER on a rendered
// frame, and not one of them was measured anywhere. Until they are, the owner IS the gate and
// each verdict costs a human evening.
//
// THE SIX, in the owner's numbering:
//
//   1. A mark inside a container is CENTRED in that container. "If you have a square somewhere,
//      I want the logo to be in the middle of the square, or at least some kind of balance."
//   2. Between an accent line and text, a mark is optically BALANCED, not crowded. "If it's too
//      close to the accent line, it feels like it's some mistake."
//   3. SECONDARY text has a floor too. Measured as the SMALLEST INFORMATIONAL line rather than
//      as "the second line" - see `measureTaste`, where reading it as the second line was blind
//      on every one-line graphic the owner used to state the rule.
//   4. WEIGHT and CONTRAST are part of legibility, not separate from it. "A size-only
//      legibility instrument passes text the owner cannot read."
//   5. A mark never eats PRIMARY real estate - B27 put the logo on top of the topic card:
//      "it takes valuable real estate - it should be on the same row as the text." NARROWED BY
//      THE OWNER 2026-08-20 and then made THRESHOLDLESS BY HIM 2026-08-21: a deliberate stack is
//      a different composition, and beyond that *"I cannot give you hard rules on where to place
//      a logo. It depends on the design."* It measures the arrangement and judges none of it.
//   6. A package's mark is present on EVERY piece or none.
//
// IT REPORTS AND DOES NOT GATE, like every instrument beside it (docs/DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md and
// the §0.2 human read). THREE of the six additionally refuse to carry a pass/fail at all, and
// they say so where they are measured: rule 2 because the owner stated it is not absolute
// ("sometimes it can work, and that's kind of the problem"), rule 3 because THE OWNER DECLINED
// THE FLOOR (2026-08-22 - see below), and rule 5 because PLACEMENT HAS NO RULE - it is a
// property of each design. An instrument that invents a threshold to settle a disagreement has
// replaced the measurement with the opinion it was built to remove.
//
// RULE 3 IS SETTLED, NOT PENDING. It read as an open re-ratification for a while: the ratified
// secondary floor in `model/designRules.ts` is 20px hard where the owner called 24px "way too
// small", and the corpus's smallest secondary reading is 26px, so any floor that changed
// anything had to sit above 26 - which flags every lower third's role line and leaves the
// countdown's 38px label alone. Put that way it was a well-formed question with a well-measured
// answer, and the owner still said no: 26px describes what this catalog happens to ship, and a
// floor read off the catalog asserts that the catalog is right. Rule 3 keeps its reading and
// mints no finding. Do not re-open it with a better number - the question was never the number.
//
// Rule 5 is the one that reached that state by being written twice, and the second version is
// the instructive one: it was measured, quiet on the whole corpus, and still wrong - because
// "a mark takes a row of its own only when the width leaves it no choice" is a placement rule,
// however well it measures. A threshold can be calibrated and still assert something its author
// does not believe.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT DUPLICATE. `spacingCheck` already measures the mark's GAP to the nearest
// text and `proportionCheck` its HEIGHT against the type; neither asks where the mark sits
// INSIDE something, which is rules 1, 2 and 5. Rule 5 in particular does NOT re-ask the gap
// question - it reports the panel's WIDTH against the arrangement the design chose, and the one
// version of it that measured crowding instead re-flagged `ls18`, the design `spacingCheck`'s own
// recalibration had just cleared (see MARK_BESIDE_GAP_RATIO).
// `readabilityCheck` already measures size, weight and contrast separately; rule 4 is the JOINT
// reading - text that clears its size floor and still cannot be read - which is a question none
// of its three findings asks, and since 2026-08-20 it is judged against the owner's own floors
// rather than that instrument's.

 * The container rule 1 measures the mark inside.

 * `markContentRect`'s own lesson, one file over), or it drops the mark into a panel that
 * already existed. The first is the commoner shape and is the one the owner's "square" usually
 * is, so it is checked first; the second is the nearest painted ancestor carrying a surface.
 *
 * A mark with NEITHER is not "inside a container" and rule 1 does not apply to it - reported as
 * null rather than measured against the frame, which would be a different question with the
 * same name.
 *
 * THE AXES ARE ASKED SEPARATELY, and the calibration sweep is what forced that. Measuring both
 * axes of the smallest surface above the mark read eight shipped designs as 0.84-0.96 off
 * centre, because a mark docked at one end of a broadcast-width strap is off-centre IN THE
 * STRAP by construction - the flow put it there and no reader sees a mistake. But restricting
 * the container to one holding the mark ALONE loses the owner's actual case: on the sponsor bug
 * the square is the tile, the tile also carries "ON AIR", and the mark not being centred ACROSS
 * it is exactly the complaint.
 *
 * Both readings are recovered by asking which axis the mark's position is FREE on:
 *
 *   - a container laying the mark BESIDE its words positions it horizontally, so horizontal is
 *     the flow's answer and VERTICAL is the one the design chose - measure that;
 *   - a container STACKING the mark over its words positions it vertically, so HORIZONTAL is
 *     the free axis - which is the sponsor-bug tile;
 *   - a well holding no words at all leaves both axes free, which is the plain "square".
 *
 * Disjointness is tested against painted TEXT only, never against every painted sibling: an
 * accent bar down the tile's left edge is disjoint from the mark horizontally and is decoration
 * on the container, not a peer the flow balanced the mark against. Including it suppressed the
 * one case this rule exists for.

      // arriving a third time by a different road.

      // `rowShare` says which arrangement the design chose, `besideSlackPx` whether the width
      // allowed the other one, `bandFill` how much of its band the mark uses. Those are the

      // asking "does the mark fit beside this line?" is the design's own geometry answering for
      // itself rather than a rule applied over the top of it.
      //
      // Crowding is not asked here either: `spacingCheck` owns the mark-to-text gap in the
      // ratified unit, and a second opinion in the mark's own height re-flags `ls18` - see
      // MARK_BESIDE_GAP_RATIO for the measurement that settled it.
