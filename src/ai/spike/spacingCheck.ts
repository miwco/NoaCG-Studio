// THE SPACING instrument - panel padding and inter-element gaps, measured as RATIOS OF TYPE
// SIZE (docs/DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md §4 proportion, §9 white space).
//
// BENCH-ONLY (see exemplars.ts for the deletion condition).
//
// THE DEFECT THIS MEASURES is the one the owner's blind reads keep naming, in their words:
// "too much space beneath ... we need a taste check for how much padding and margin the text
// and the banner should have"; "the name text too close to the line and it's too tight ... too
// big for the banner so it looks crammed"; "a bit too much space between the logo and the
// text"; "the text is on top of the line. It's all crammed in". Across two rounds, every failed
// or repair-needed item names proportion, white space or alignment and almost nothing else.
// Alignment already has an instrument (axisCheck.ts). This is the other two.
//
// WHY RATIOS AND NOT PIXELS. A 24px gap is generous beside 16px text and cramped beside 64px
// text, and every graphic here carries a --scale knob plus a --type-scale knob that move them
// independently. An absolute threshold would therefore measure the knobs rather than the
// design. The unit is the PRIMARY TYPE SIZE - the largest painted text in the composition -
// because that is what a viewer's eye normalises against, and because it is what "proportion"
// means: size relationships between parts, not sizes.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It does not gate. It reports numbers and named findings beside the
// frame, exactly as the axis instrument and the rendered mark gate do, and the §0.2 human read
// stays the verdict. Two reasons, both learned here: a spacing judgement flips on the brief's
// world (the same plate was praised on two briefs and called broken on a third), and a gate
// that fails a deliberate full-bleed composition would be teaching designs to be timid.

 * THE UNIT USED TO BE THE MARK'S OWN HEIGHT, and that is what this pair of numbers changed
 * (2026-08-15). The brand manual's clear space is a quarter of a mark's height, so a
 * mark-height unit looked like the principled choice - but a lower third's mark is not a
 * free-standing mark, it is a member of a lockup, and expressing its clear space in its own
 * height DIVIDES A DESIGN BY ITS OWN GENEROSITY. Measured over the 24 mark-capable lower thirds
 * (`scripts/spike-mark-clearance-sweep.mjs`), that produced pairs no reader can defend: ls18
 * was called crowded at **22px** of clear space while lt08 passed at exactly 22px, and ls25 was
 * called crowded at **30px** while lt15 passed at 26px. In both pairs the flagged design has
 * the same or a LARGER gap and a much taller mark (135px and 130px against 75px and 84px). The
 * two designs the old unit flagged are the two that give their mark the most room.
 *
 * THE FIX IS THE UNIT THIS FILE ALREADY USES EVERYWHERE ELSE. Its own header states why:
 * the primary type size is what a viewer's eye normalises against, and it is what "proportion"
 * means. In type sizes the same 24 designs run 0.41 to 1.61 and neither flagged design is an
 * outlier - ls18 is 8th of 24 at 0.51 and ls25 is 13th at 0.70, dead middle. The unit also
 * clusters far more tightly: p95/p05 is 2.9x in type sizes against 4.3x in mark heights, and a
 * distribution that spreads over four-fold has no floor to put under it.
 *
 * NOTHING IS LOST BY DROPPING THE MARK'S HEIGHT, because the other instrument still asks about
 * it. `proportionCheck`'s `mark-oversized` measures the mark's height against the type size
 * (ceiling 3.2, calibrated on the BORDER box), so a design cannot dodge this floor by growing
 * its mark: it hits that ceiling instead. Two questions, two boxes, two instruments - and this
 * one is now asking only about the GAP.
 *
 * THE NUMBERS ARE READ OFF THE CATALOG, never chosen (the `spike-spacing-calibrate.mjs`
 * discipline, and the same rule PADDING_FLOOR_RATIO and RULE_GAP_FLOOR_RATIO already follow):
 *
 * - **Floor 0.35** sits under the catalog's own tightest shipped pairing, lt08 at 0.41, with
 *   ~15% of margin and inside a real gap - the next reading up is 0.45. Phase A's composer
 *   renders 0.48 seated and 0.72 with a painted mark band, so it clears by 1.4x and 2.1x.
 * - **Ceiling 2.1** carries the same ~1.3x headroom over the catalog's widest shipped lockup
 *   (lt54 at 1.61) that the old 1.6 ceiling carried over its own widest reading (1.2).
 *
 * The GAP is still measured from the mark's INK rather than its border box - see
 * `markContentRect`. That question is about where the clear space is drawn and is untouched by
 * which unit it is reported in.

 * THE MARK'S INK, not the well it sits in - the visual rect inset by the element's own padding

 * on lt07 (0.22), lt41 (0.24) and ls10 (0.20) against a 0.25 floor, and all three are among the
 * designs that carry a crest BEST: each draws the mark inside a well and expresses the brand
 * manual's clear space as the image's OWN PADDING. `getBoundingClientRect` reports the border
 * box, so that clear space was inside the thing being measured - the instrument counted the gap
 * from the outside of the space to the text, which is by definition nearly zero, and then called
 * the design cramped for it. Measured over the 24 mark-capable lower thirds
 * (`scripts/spike-mark-clearance-sweep.mjs`), the ink box moves those three to 0.36, 0.39 and
 * 0.42 and leaves every other reading alone.
 *
 * AN INSTRUMENT WHOSE FALSE POSITIVES ARE THE GOOD DESIGNS IS ONE AUTHORS LEARN TO IGNORE, which
 * is worse than no instrument - the same argument this file already makes for the deliberate
 * bleed and for `LINE_GAP_FLOOR_RATIO` sitting at zero.
 *
 * THE UNIT IS NO LONGER THE MARK AT ALL. When this was written the gap was divided by the ink's
 * own height, so both halves of the ratio had to move together. The unit is now the primary type
 * size (MARK_GAP_FLOOR_RATIO says why), which leaves this function with exactly one job: say
 * where the mark's clear space ENDS. The reading it fixes is unchanged - a design expressing that
 * clear space as the image's own padding had it counted as zero either way.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NOT SHARED WITH `proportionCheck`. Its `mark-oversized` finding asks how much ROOM
 * a mark takes in the composition, and a padded well takes all of it - the border box is the right
 * answer there, and `MARK_SCALE_CEILING` is calibrated on it. Two questions, two boxes.
 *
 * IT IS SHARED WITH `tasteCheck`, and by the same test: its rules 1, 2 and 5 all ask where the
 * mark's INK sits - inside its well, beside an accent, across a row - which is this box's exact
 * question. Exported rather than copied, because a second implementation of "where does the
 * clear space end" is how two instruments come to disagree about one mark.
 *
 * `getComputedStyle` is read while the document is still attached, which is the only time it
 * answers: a live `CSSStyleDeclaration` EMPTIES the moment its iframe leaves the DOM, and every
 * length silently parses as 0 - an inset of nothing, reported as a measurement.
