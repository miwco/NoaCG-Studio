// PHASE 1 BRAND ROUND - the synthetic brand condition, and THE LOGO CONTRACT for a
// GENERATED design (docs/NOACG_PRO_PLAN.md §14 items 0 and 1, docs/PRO_PHASE1_HANDOFF.md).
//
// BENCH-ONLY (see exemplars.ts for the deletion condition). Its only caller is
// scripts/pro-spike.mjs, through run.ts.
//
// Phase 0 proved the checkpoint can design a GENERIC lower third and the owner's verdict was
// that generic output is free-gallery material - Pro's premise is originality conditioned on a
// customer's own brand, which Phase 0 never measured. This file is that condition: an invented
// organisation's name, palette, typeface and REAL mark file (benchmarks/pro/v1/spike/brands.json),
// with the mark's shape, backing and ink MEASURED by `assets/assetInfo.ts` `probeMark` - the same
// content-free descriptor Lite sends (`LiteMarkDescriptor`), so the two tiers describe a mark in
// one vocabulary.
//
// THE LOGO CONTRACT, in one sentence: **the design declares the slot and the platform fills it;
// the model never places the mark.** That is Lite's proven shape (`LiteCatalogEntry.logoSlot`,
// gated by scripts/ai-lite-brand-audit.mjs against a rendered measurement) moved to a world with
// no catalog slot to declare:
//
//   - the DECLARATION is part of the emitted design itself - one `filelist` field bound to an
//     empty `<img id="fN">`, whose geometry and surface are the model's design decisions;
//   - the FILL is deterministic (`fillBrandMark`): bake the file's path into the img, set the
//     field's default, bundle the asset - the fillProLogoSlot recipe, running inside the ground
//     step so every repair round re-emits against a FILLED template;
//   - the GATE is a rendered measurement (`measureRenderedMark`), with the Lite brand audit's
//     own thresholds - because the one defect every deterministic Phase 0 gate passed was a
//     broken-image icon with its alt text showing, and a gate that reads markup instead of the
//     painted frame would pass it again.
//
// The MOTION half has no precedent anywhere (the owner asked for marks that "animate in a
// meaningful and smooth way"): the contract makes the slot part of the entrance/exit like any
// other element, `markMotionState` samples it through the virtual clock, and whether the motion
// is MEANINGFUL stays a human read of the strips - a measurement can only say whether it moved.

## The brand mark's slot (the platform fills it)

The customer's mark is a REAL file and the platform places it - you never draw the mark, never
guess its artwork, and never write its src. You declare WHERE it lives, and that declaration is
a design decision like any other:

- Add ONE image field to the SPX definition - \`"ftype": "filelist"\`, title "Logo" - after the
  text fields, bound to \`<img id="fN" class="…-logo" alt="">\` in the markup with NO src
  attribute. The platform bakes the file in before validation.
- DO NOT HIDE THE IMG YOURSELF. The empty state is already handled: \`setFieldValue\` sets
  \`display: none\` on the img inline when the field is cleared and removes it when a file
  arrives, so a \`display: none\` of your own in template.css is a mark that never appears -
  the design has to un-hide it with a rule, and a rule keyed one level off leaves the customer
  looking at an empty slot. If you want a layout that reacts to the mark's presence, key it on
  \`.has-image\`, which lands on the img's PARENT.
- THE PLATFORM PLACES AND SIZES THE MARK. It goes into a leading column of your box, beside
  the text and vertically centred, at a measured height with free width so a crest and a wide
  wordmark both read - and where its ink needs a reading surface, that column becomes the
  surface. So do not draw a plate, a card or a panel behind it, do not write its width or
  height, and do not build a container to hold it: an \`<img>\` with your own class on it is the
  whole declaration. Design the graphic around a mark that will be there; the seat is ours.
- Everything else about the mark is still yours - whether the composition leads with it or
  leans on the text, how much air the panel carries, what the mark sits NEXT to. The mark is
  the customer's and it arrives as-is: it is never cropped, rounded, filtered or unevenly
  scaled, by you or by us.
- The mark is part of the composition, so it is part of the motion: bring it in and out inside
  the ANIMATION region with the same intent as the text - it should arrive meaningfully and
  smoothly, never pop in unannounced and never just sit there while the rest of the graphic
  moves.`;

// surface stops being a thing a model can get wrong. This is the same split Lite already ships
// and the same one the rest of this contract follows - the design declares the SLOT, the
// platform decides what goes under it, the model never draws it - mapped onto authored
// graphics: the model owns WHERE the mark sits and HOW BIG it is, because those are
// composition; the platform owns what its ink reads against, because that is legibility.
//
// The decision is deterministic and needs no rendering, which is what lets it run inside the
// fill (the ground step) rather than after a capture:
//
//   * an OWN-FIELD mark brings its own background and never needs one;
//   * a TRANSPARENT mark is compared against the panel the design DECLARES (`--panel-bg` in
//     its own `:root`), and a pair that already clears WCAG's 3:1 non-text floor is left alone
//     - a surface nothing needs is furniture;
//   * otherwise the platform draws a FIELD.
//
// The honest limit, stated rather than hidden: `--panel-bg` is what the design says its panel
// is, not necessarily what the mark lands on - a slot placed outside the box sits on the
// footage. When the token cannot be read the platform draws nothing and lets the rendered gate
// report `ink-contrast`, because adding furniture on a guess is a visible defect and a missed
// contrast finding is a reported one.

 * the mark in a grid column of a box it controls - so Pro takes the same thing.
 *
 * The model still DECLARES the slot: the filelist field and the `<img id="fN">` are its
 * emit, which is what keeps the SPX field contract the model's and the operator's. What moves
 * is WHERE that img sits - to the first column of the box - and the sizing, which comes with
 * placement because a column's width is a placement decision. The size is the catalog's own
 * audited recipe rather than a fresh guess (a fixed height with free width and a wordmark cap:
 * `benchmarks/lite/BRAND-AUDIT-2026-08-09.md`, the 56px-square finding).
 *
 * The surgery is a real DOM move rather than a regex, because "take this element out of
 * wherever it is and make it the first child of that one" is not a string operation and this
 * module already runs in a browser. A wrapper the mark leaves EMPTY is removed with it: the
 * model's own logo container usually carries the plate it drew, and leaving that behind would

/*
 * WHY THE DECISION SHIPS AND THE DRAWING DOES NOT (2026-08-13, measured twice).
 *
 * Deciding the surface needs nothing from the design's layout, so it is deterministic and it
 * is above. DRAWING one needs the design's layout to hold still, and it does not:
 *
 *   1. A wrapper with `align-self: stretch` and padding. The property computed to `stretch` on
 *      all three generations that needed a field and the USED height stayed the mark's own -
 *      the slot sits inside the design's own flex container and the mark's `height: 100%`
 *      makes the cross size circular. So the field came out hugging the mark, which is the
 *      defect it exists to remove, and its padding ate 24px of the mark on the way (two marks
 *      dropped under the minimum legible size).
 *   2. A `display: contents` wrapper painting the band from a bleeding `::before`. The mark
 *      kept its exact size, and the band landed in the wrong place entirely - with no box of
 *      its own the pseudo-element resolves against whatever ancestor happens to be positioned,
 *      so it painted a slab across the middle of the panel, over the text. And the rendered
 *      gate cannot see a pseudo-element at all: it walks real ancestors for a painted
 *      background, so even a correct band would have reported `ink-contrast` as a failure.
 *
 * The lesson both attempts teach is the same one, and it is about the SPLIT rather than the
 * CSS: a surface can only be "a band of the composition" if the platform knows the
 * composition. Lite can draw one because Lite owns the placement too - `applyLogoSlot` puts
 * the mark in a grid column of the box it controls. Taking the surface while leaving placement
 * to the model asks the platform to draw a shape inside a layout it has never seen.
 *
 * So the honest structural version is the fuller one: the platform owns the mark's PLACEMENT
 * as well as its surface. That is a bigger change than a fill-time CSS append and it takes
 * composition back from the model, which is a product decision rather than an implementation
 * one - docs/NOACG_PRO_PLAN.md §14 item 1 carries it.
 */

/**
 * THE FILLED MARK PAINTS. That is the contract, and this is the line that makes it true
 * rather than likely.
 *
 * Stamping `has-image` (above) rescues a design whose reveal rule is keyed one level too high,
 * but not one whose reveal targets the WRONG ELEMENT - `.PREFIX-logo-container.has-image {
 * display: flex }` sets the container's display and never un-hides the `<img>` inside it, so
 * the mark is gone no matter which ancestor carries the class. Both shapes start the same way:
 * the design writes `display: none` on the img "until an image is provided" and then has to
 * write a second rule to undo it, and the second rule is the one nothing in the prompt
 * describes.
 *
 * It is redundant code to begin with. `setFieldValue` sets and clears `display` INLINE on the
 * img, so the empty state never needed a stylesheet rule - which is also why this override is
 * safe: an operator clearing the field still gets the inline `display: none`, and inline wins.
 *
 * Scoped to the one filled id and appended last, so it outranks the design's own class rule by
 * specificity and order without touching anything else. `block` rather than `revert` because
 * the UA default for an img is inline, and a slot styled `height: 100%; width: auto;
 * object-fit: contain` is being drawn as a box.
 */

/**
 * STAMP `has-image` ON THE ROOT AND THE BOX, so a design that keys its mark's reveal there
 * still shows the mark.
 *
 * The models have to guess where that class lands, because nothing tells them. The shared
 * runtime's `setFieldValue` - the helper the prompt says to copy verbatim - toggles it on the
 * img's PARENT (`templates/shared/base.ts`), while the prompt only says to use "the has-image
 * pattern from the example" and the neutral skeleton the example slot carries has no image
 * field in it at all. A prompt line pointing at an example that does not contain the thing is
 * dead teaching, and it failed the way dead teaching does: five of the ablation round's twelve
 * marks never painted, every one of them the same construction - the design hid its own
 * `<img>` by default and wrote `.PREFIX.has-image .PREFIX-logo { display: block }` to bring it
 * back, anchoring the class one level above where it actually appears.
 *
 * A mark that does not paint is worse than a mark on an ugly plate, so this repairs rather
 * than reports (the Lite rule: a legibility rule must repair, not refuse). Adding a class can
 * only ENABLE a rule the design already wrote, never hide anything - and the empty state is
 * unaffected, because the runtime sets `display: none` INLINE when the field is cleared, which
 * outranks any stylesheet reveal. The violation is still recorded: `hadOwnSrc` has a sibling
 * now, and a design needing the stamp is a design whose own selector was wrong.
