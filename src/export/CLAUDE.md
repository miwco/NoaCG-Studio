# src/export - export targets & packaging

Loaded alongside the root CLAUDE.md when working in this directory. Keep it accurate. Exported
packages must be plug-and-play - relative paths, bundled GSAP, no CDN references - and
validation gates every export (root non-negotiables 3 and 4).

- **registry.ts** - 6 targets, each with its own successMessage + ExportContext (the Data
  panel's sampleData rides along so serverless targets can bake it).
- **slug.ts** - shared slug helper (lives here to avoid an import cycle).
- **selfContained.ts** - single-file composer: inline CSS/GSAP/JS/assets/FONTS + extra body
  scripts. ASYNC, because the fonts are fetched to be embedded.
- **bundledFonts.ts** - the one place that knows how a builder font leaves the app. Generated CSS
  always says `url("fonts/<file>")`; there are exactly two ways to honour that, and the package
  shape picks one. A FOLDER package ships the file beside the HTML (common.ts
  `addReferencedFonts`); a SINGLE-FILE package has no sibling to ship to, so `inlineBundledFonts`
  embeds the bytes as a data: URL. Call it AFTER inlineAssetRefs - an imported font is an asset
  and is already substituted by then, so whatever still matches is builder-bundled. A font that
  cannot be fetched THROWS here (the folder writer only skips): nothing downstream fails when a
  face is missing, because `font-display: swap` just paints the fallback, so the graphic would
  play out in the wrong typeface with no error anywhere. That was a real shipped bug in all three
  single-file targets. Pinned by exports.spec.ts, which opens each one alone over `file://` -
  setContent() and srcdoc both inherit the dev server's base URL and hide exactly this class of
  defect.
- **targets/spxStarter.ts** - the one SPX export = spxTarget, id 'spx'; + buildStarterInto,
  reused by packets.
- **targets/htmlOverlay.ts** - OBS/vMix browser source: an autoplay block fills fields from baked
  sampleData -> definition defaults, then play(). An auto-out `out` = N ms setting rides
  along: the block measures the entrance from a paused throwaway timeline and schedules
  stop() at entrance + delay (the bundled control panel's Stop still works sooner). Receiver
  + controlpanel.html bundled.
- **targets/h2r.ts** - H2R Custom HTML: GDD block from DataFields + play()-toggle shim.
- **targets/casparcg.ts** - selfContained + JSON/XML data shim.
- **targets/ograf.ts** - EBU OGraf v1: manifest from DataFields + graphic.mjs Web Component;
  AMD-guarded gsap loader. `addOgrafPackage` is reused by **targets/liveos.ts** - LiveOS's HTML5
  graphics engine is OGraf-compliant, so that target is the same package with NetOn.Live install
  steps in the README.
- **packetExport.ts** - whole packet -> one zip, a Starter folder per graphic.
- **common.ts** - addSharedAssets, addReferencedFonts, injectControlReceiver + addControlPanel,
  FONT_LICENSES.md.

## Font licensing (the rule: the licence follows the BYTES)

The seven bundled faces are OFL 1.1. §2 requires every redistributed copy of the font software
to CONTAIN the copyright notice and the licence - as a stand-alone text file, a human-readable
header, or readable metadata. A LINK satisfies none of those, and §2 is triggered by
REDISTRIBUTION, not by sale, so the product being free does not retire it. The binaries have
name ID 13 stripped and an empty WOFF2 metadata block, so there is no in-binary fallback either.

`src/assets/OFL.txt` is the single source: the full licence plus all seven copyright lines. It
sits in `src/assets/` beside the other bundled-and-inlined sources rather than next to the fonts
in `public/`, because Vite refuses `?raw` imports out of the public directory. It is imported
into `model/fonts.ts` as `FONT_LICENSE_NOTE` (stand-alone form) and `fontLicenseComment()`
(header form), and read from disk by the two build scripts that embed font bytes. Two
consequences worth remembering:
`addReferencedFonts` keys the notice off the BYTES in the package (CSS refs OR a font in
`template.assets`) rather than off a regex match, and a surface that embeds fonts and cannot
ship a sibling file - a single-file export, the player host, the generated worker CSS - carries
the header instead. exports.spec.ts asserts every package that ships font bytes also ships the
text.

## Packaging conventions

- Asset paths: uploads land at `images/<file>` (fonts at `fonts/<file>`); the export zip wraps
  everything in one project folder, so extracting into a templates folder yields
  `[TemplatesFolder]/<project>/index.html` + `<project>/images/<file>` - the layout SPX and
  CasparCG expect. Both of those exporters use `zip.folder(slug(name))`.
- Uploads are base64 data URLs in `template.assets[]`; the preview inlines them, the exporter
  decodes them to real files. The Assets panel may nest ONE user folder inside a bucket
  (`images/logos/<file>`) - every writer zips `asset.path` verbatim, so nesting flows through.
- Lottie: a template that uses a Lottie animation (detector `assets/lottieSupport.ts`) ships
  the bundled player - `js/lottie.min.js` in folder packages (addSharedAssets), inlined in
  single-file targets, `lib/lottie.min.js` + an `ensureLottie()` loader in OGraf packages,
  where the embedded TEMPLATE_HTML also gets its `.json` assets inlined as data: URLs (an
  embedded string has no base URL to resolve a relative path against). The generated
  bootstrap decodes data: URLs inline (atob, no fetch), so single-file exports play from
  file:// too; the folder starter keeps the real `lottie/<file>.json` and plays over http
  (SPX's normal serving mode).
