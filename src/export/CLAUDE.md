# src/export - export targets & packaging

Loaded alongside the root CLAUDE.md when working in this directory. Keep it accurate. Exported
packages must be plug-and-play - relative paths, bundled GSAP, no CDN references - and
validation gates every export (root non-negotiables 3 and 4).

- **registry.ts** - 6 targets, each with its own successMessage + ExportContext (the Data
  panel's sampleData rides along so serverless targets can bake it).
- **slug.ts** - shared slug helper (lives here to avoid an import cycle).
- **selfContained.ts** - single-file composer: inline CSS/GSAP/JS/assets + extra body scripts.
- **targets/spxStarter.ts** - the one SPX export = spxTarget, id 'spx'; + buildStarterInto,
  reused by packets.
- **targets/htmlOverlay.ts** - OBS/vMix browser source: an autoplay block fills fields from baked
  sampleData -> definition defaults, then play(); receiver + controlpanel.html bundled.
- **targets/h2r.ts** - H2R Custom HTML: GDD block from DataFields + play()-toggle shim.
- **targets/casparcg.ts** - selfContained + JSON/XML data shim.
- **targets/ograf.ts** - EBU OGraf v1: manifest from DataFields + graphic.mjs Web Component;
  AMD-guarded gsap loader. `addOgrafPackage` is reused by **targets/liveos.ts** - LiveOS's HTML5
  graphics engine is OGraf-compliant, so that target is the same package with NetOn.Live install
  steps in the README.
- **packetExport.ts** - whole packet -> one zip, a Starter folder per graphic.
- **common.ts** - addSharedAssets, addReferencedFonts, injectControlReceiver + addControlPanel,
  FONT_LICENSES.md.

## Packaging conventions

- Asset paths: uploads land at `images/<file>` (fonts at `fonts/<file>`); the export zip wraps
  everything in one project folder, so extracting into a templates folder yields
  `[TemplatesFolder]/<project>/index.html` + `<project>/images/<file>` - the layout SPX and
  CasparCG expect. Both of those exporters use `zip.folder(slug(name))`.
- Uploads are base64 data URLs in `template.assets[]`; the preview inlines them, the exporter
  decodes them to real files.
