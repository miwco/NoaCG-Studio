// Whole-show export (Phase 5): one zip with every graphic of the show as its own SPX
// Starter folder PLUS one aggregated show_controlpanel.html at the root — the show's
// control page, generated from every graphic's fields and state machine. Run each
// graphic's own .html as a browser source and open the show panel FROM THE SAME
// http(s) ORIGIN in the same browser: every card drives its graphic over that graphic's
// own BroadcastChannel (same-origin only — file:// pages cannot pair).
//
// Each graphic's saved control-panel ENTRIES live in the library, not in the show's embedded
// copy — they are resolved out of the library at export time (entriesForSavedGraphic, by
// graphicId with a unique-name fallback, the same resolver the hosted control page uses) and
// baked into both the aggregated panel and each graphic's own controlpanel.html.

// TWO PLAYOUT RULES this exporter owns (student-release acceptance findings, 2026-08-05):
// 1. NO HOSTED RECEIVER. SPX/CasparCG are the controller for these files — a baked log
//    follower is a second controller fighting the host: its boot recovery snaps the graphic
//    to its last REPORTED state (usually off) one RPC round-trip after the host's play(),
//    which read as "the graphic flashes in and disappears" on a real CasparCG server.
//    Cloud-driven browser sources are the HTML-overlay flavor's job, opt-in, not this one's.
// 2. DISTINCT LAYERS. Every generated template used to declare playlayer/webplayout '7', so
//    two templates in one SPX rundown silently evicted each other. Here each pool graphic
//    gets its own layer from its pool position (paint order), like real SPX packs do.
