// The shared countdown-clock runtime, used by the starting-soon and game-timer categories.
// It emits teachable ES5 that lives OUTSIDE the marked ANIMATION region (it is playout
// logic, not motion): the animation presets only call startClock() / stopClock().
//
// Contract with the design:
//   - a hidden <div id="fN" class="noacg-data-source"> holds the duration in whole minutes
//     (decimals allowed: "0.5" is thirty seconds) — SPX writes into it like any field.
//     The hider is a CSS rule, never an inline style: the editor's entrance reset clears
//     inline props (base.ts DATA_SOURCE_CLASS), which would un-hide an inline-hidden holder
//   - OPTIONALLY a second hidden field holds a wall-clock START TIME ("19:30"). When the
//     operator fills it in it WINS over the duration, which is what "counts down to the
//     start of the show" actually means: the number on screen agrees with the clock on
//     the wall, however long the graphic has been up.
//   - a .{prefix}-clock element displays the remaining time (M:SS, or H:MM:SS past an hour)
//   - when the clock hits zero the root gets a .{prefix}-done class, so the design's CSS
//     can flash, recolor, or swap text without any extra JS
//
// UPDATE RE-ARMS THE CLOCK (owner walk, 2026-08-29). The length a countdown counts is DATA -
// the operator types it into a field like any other - so a new value takes effect the moment
// they press Update, running or not. That is not a state change and does not need one: the
// graphic stays in exactly the state it was in and re-derives what it displays, the same way a
// name field re-derives the name (docs/STATE_MACHINE_SCHEMA.md - update() writes fields, events
// move states). Before this, a running clock read its length once at startClock() and ignored
// every later value, so the only way to correct a countdown on air was to take it out and back
// in - the one thing an operator cannot do to a screen the audience is watching.
// The safety is in `clockDataUpdated()` below: it re-arms only when the clock's OWN fields
// changed, so an Update carrying a new headline never restarts the count under it.
//
// ACCURACY: the count is anchored to a DEADLINE timestamp, not decremented once per tick.
// A holding screen can sit on air for an hour, and `setInterval` drifts — it is throttled in
// a background tab, coalesced on a loaded playout machine, and never fires early. Recomputing
// the remaining time from the deadline on every tick makes a late tick self-correcting instead
// of cumulative, so the clock still agrees with the wall at 0:00. (Under the render service's
// virtual clock, Date.now() is virtualized too — src/render/runtimeScript.ts — so a rendered
// countdown stays a pure function of the frame.)
