// The MATCH CLOCK — the sports clock a scorebug runs, and the sports pack's one piece of
// genuinely stateful playout logic.
//
// It is design-owned runtime JS, emitted OUTSIDE the marked ANIMATION region exactly like
// shared/clock.ts, for the same reason: a clock is playout, not motion. The state machine's
// `clock` group only CALLS into it (`startMatchClock` / `stopMatchClock` / `resetMatchClock`),
// so the timeline can rewrite the entrance all it likes and the clock keeps running.
//
// Three things make this an operator tool rather than a decoration:
//
//   1. IT COUNTS BOTH WAYS. Football counts up to 45:00, basketball and hockey count DOWN to
//      0:00, and a period that reaches zero has to stop itself and say so. The direction is a
//      DESIGN decision, declared on the clock element as `data-count="up" | "down"` — an
//      operator never has to pick it, and a template cannot end up in the wrong sport.
//   2. THE OPERATOR OWNS THE VALUE. The clock element IS a data field (`id="fN"`), so typing
//      "43:12" into the control page re-seeds the running clock. Every live clock drifts from
//      the stadium's, and a scorebug you cannot correct is a scorebug you stop trusting.
//   3. RESET IS A SEPARATE OPERATION. `resetMatchClock` returns to the element's own
//      `data-start`, never to zero-by-assumption — the same "reset is two operations" rule the
//      state machine holds for visual state and data (docs/STATE_MACHINE_SCHEMA.md).
//   4. TICKING IS DISPLAY, NOT STATE (2026-08-19). The clock's truth is a TIME ORIGIN — a value
//      and the instant it was true — and every renderer paints `origin value ± elapsed`. It used
//      to be a counter each renderer incremented once a second in its own memory, which is three
//      live faults at once: two renderers started a second apart stayed a second apart forever
//      and drifted further whenever either was throttled (a browser source in a background tab
//      is throttled to roughly one timer a minute); a monitor that unmounted and came back
//      restarted from the seed; and a browser-source RELOAD at 67 minutes aired 0:00, because
//      the only copy of "67" was in the memory that had just been thrown away.
//
//      The origin travels as the clock FIELD's own value, with the instant appended:
//      `"45:00@1755600000000"`. That syntax is why the fix needs no new field, no new message
//      and no new report — a clock value already rides every Take, Update and boot recovery, and
//      an origin-stamped one is IDEMPOTENT: re-sending it a minute later still resolves to the
//      right time, where re-sending a counter's snapshot pulled the clock backwards. A plain
//      value with no `@` is a HELD time, which is exactly what every existing template, export
//      and typed correction already sends.
//
// Everything here is prefix-parameterized, so a scoreboard-category board and an
// infographic-category match centre share one implementation.

/**
 * The match-clock runtime for a category prefix ('scoreboard', 'infographic').
 *
 * Contract with the design:
 *   - one `.{prefix}-clock` element, which SHOULD also carry a field id so the operator can
 *     correct it; `data-count="down"` counts down (default is up), `data-start="45:00"` is
 *     what `resetMatchClock` returns to (default is the element's initial text);
 *   - the root `.{prefix}` gains `.{prefix}-final` at full time, `.{prefix}-break` during an
 *     interval, and `.{prefix}-expired` when a counting-down clock reaches zero, so a design
 *     styles each of the three without any of them being a separate state to animate.

//                           reporting a stopped clock. Adopt it as the base.
//   "45:00@1755600000000"   a RUNNING clock: it read 45:00 at that instant. Adopt both, and
//                           the derived value is right however long ago that was — which is
//                           what makes a reopened browser source come back at the real match
//                           time instead of at the seed.
//
// A STAMPED value is safe to adopt every single time, because it is time-relative: re-sending
// it a minute later still resolves to the right second. A PLAIN one is not, which is what the
// guard below is for. Every Take, ✎ Update and Snap sends the cue's WHOLE value set
// (control/hostedControl.ts), so a score bump in the 64th minute resends the clock field
// carrying whatever was last TYPED into it — adopting that would pull a running clock back to
// its typed value on every goal. Comparing against the element's own text cannot tell a resend
// from a correction either: the element holds the RUNNING time, so a resend differs from it
// every second. What distinguishes a correction is that the value the wire carries CHANGED.
//
// IT IS THE PLAIN HALF THAT MUST BE COMPARED (fixed 2026-08-21, measured on air). The guard used
// to compare against the whole of the last value received, and once a control surface began
// stamping the origin that was no longer the operator's value: the wire had delivered
// "20:00@1755600000000", the cue still stored "20:00", and the two differ — so a goal in the
// 5th minute read as a correction and re-anchored a running clock back to 20:00. The stamp is
// OURS, not the operator's, and the operator's value had not changed at all.
//
// The honest limit, unchanged: re-sending a plain value identical to the last one received is a
// no-op, so an operator cannot re-apply the time the clock already holds. No control surface can
// express that anyway (the field already holds that text, so there is no edit to send), and
