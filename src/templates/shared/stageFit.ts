// THE HEIGHT HALF OF THE STAGE CONTRACT: a staged panel must not grow TALLER either.
//
// `stageBoxCss` (shared/base.ts) stops a board changing WIDTH with the operator's text. That is
// half the job, and on several categories it is the smaller half: the text that can no longer
// widen a board wraps onto another row and makes it taller instead. Measured 2026-08-20 over the
// registry, quiz, alert, public-info and results-board move ONLY vertically - their widths were
// already pinned by a `min-width` floor, which is not a fix but a change of axis.
//
// THE ROOM IS THE DESIGN'S OWN, AND NOBODY HAS TO TYPE IT. A line's reserve is the number of rows
// it occupies with the design's OWN sample text - the content the design was calibrated against,
// and the content sitting in the emitted HTML before any operator touches it. So this runtime
// measures each line once, at load, and holds every later value to what it found. That is the same
// derivation the stage width uses (the width a design settles at with realistic content), and it
// means a category can be flipped without annotating hundreds of designs with row counts that
// would then have to be re-measured every time a typeface or a size step moved.
//
// SHRINK, NEVER CLIP. Past the reserve the line reduces its font size, down to a floor - the same
// lever and the same 55% floor as `fitPlacedText` (shared/textFit.ts), and for the same reason:
// size is the honest answer, a horizontal condense distorts the typeface the user chose, and an
// ellipsis silently drops the operator's words. Below the floor the line is unreadable on air,
// which is worse than tight, so it stops there and the panel is allowed to be the one thing that
// gives - by then the operator has typed something no board was drawn to hold.
//
// WHY THE SHRINK STEP IS A SQUARE ROOT. Reducing font size shortens the text AND the row it sits
// on, so a wrapped block's height falls roughly with the SQUARE of the size: half the size is a
// quarter of the height. Scaling by the linear ratio (`room / scrollHeight`) therefore overshoots
// hard - a line 20% too tall would come back 20% smaller when 10% was enough - and the first draft
// of this made a two-row headline visibly smaller than its own subtitle. `sqrt` converges in two
// passes and lands on a size a designer would have picked.
//
// It is design-owned JS, emitted OUTSIDE the marked ANIMATION region like `shared/clock.ts` and
// the category motion runtimes, so the timeline never rewrites it and it survives every export.
