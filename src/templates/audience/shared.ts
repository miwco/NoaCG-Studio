// Audience scaffolding — the graphics that put the AUDIENCE on screen: the viewer question, the
// Q&A card, the chat highlight, the moderator's question queue, and the community or prayer
// request. Talk shows, livestreams, podcasts, webinars, churches and conferences all run these,
// and on air they are one object seen from five angles: a panel, a label saying what kind of
// message this is, the message itself, and a line saying who sent it and from where.
//
// ONE CATEGORY, FIVE FORMS. A form declares its FIELDS and the runtime it needs; the assembler
// is the same for all five. That is what keeps the attribution rules, the long-message
// handling, the style contract and the export path written once.
//
// Structure contract (a form draws the parts it needs and no others):
//   <div class="audience">                 root — zone positioned; opacity:0 until play()
//     <div class="audience-box">           the panel; presets tween this
//       [<div class="audience-accent">]    the family's accent bar, where it has one
//       [<div class="audience-kicker"><span id="fN">…</span></div>]   what kind of message
//       [<div class="audience-mask"><span class="audience-question" id="fN">…</span></div>]
//       [<div class="audience-answer">…</div>]        the Q&A card's answer (revealed on Continue)
//       [<div id="audience-queue"></div>]             the queue's rows, rendered at runtime
//       [<div class="audience-by">                    who sent it, and from where
//          <span class="audience-asker" id="fN">…</span>
//          <span class="audience-anon">Anonymous</span>
//          <span class="audience-sep"></span>
//          <span class="audience-source" id="fN">…</span>
//        </div>]
//     </div>
//   </div>
//
// THE PLATFORM IS TEXT, NEVER A LOGO. "Where this came from" is an ordinary operator field, so
// the same card serves YouTube, Twitch, Zoom, a church app, a webinar tool or a stack of paper
// slips handed up from the room. Baking in one platform's mark would make the graphic wrong for
// every other, would date, and would put someone else's trademark in a template the user owns.
//
// AND EVERY FORM IS FULLY USABLE BY HAND. Nothing here reads a chat API: an operator types the
// message, the name and the source into ordinary SPX fields, exactly as they type a lower
// third. A future integration would fill the same fields; it is not a precondition for any of it.
