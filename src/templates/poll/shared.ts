// Poll scaffolding — the LIVE VOTE board: a question, the options an audience is voting on,
// the share each one has, and the moment a winner is called. It covers the audience poll, the
// on-stream vote, the referendum call and the election-style result board, because on air those
// are one graphic with different copy.
//
// Polls are DATA-DRIVEN, like tickers and credits: a textarea field (f1) holds the options —
// one "Label | count" per line — and the template's JS renders them. That is what lets the same
// board carry two options or six without a second design, and it is why the bars are MEASURED
// motion (poll/pollMotion.ts): both the widths and the number of bars are the operator's
// content, and no static keyframe can hold either.
//
// Structure contract:
//   <div class="poll">                    root — zone positioned; opacity:0 until play()
//     <div class="poll-box">              the panel; presets tween this
//       <div class="poll-mask"><span id="f0">…</span></div>   the question (mask-up reveal)
//       <div class="poll-cue">…</div>     the VOTE NOW badge — it LEAVES when voting closes
//       <div id="poll-rows"></div>        the option rows, rendered by pollRebuild()
//       <div class="poll-foot"><span id="f2">…</span></div>   the count / "% reporting" line
//     </div>
//     hidden #f1 source SPX writes the options into
//   </div>
//
// One row, as the design's renderPollRow() builds it:
//   <div class="poll-row">
//     <div class="poll-row-top">
//       <span class="poll-row-label">Streaming</span>
//       <span class="poll-row-value" data-target="42.3%">42.3%</span>
//     </div>
//     <div class="poll-bar"><div class="poll-bar-fill" data-value="42.3"></div></div>
//   </div>
//
// THE TWO RULES A DESIGN MUST HONOUR, both enforced by the shared CSS below rather than by
// trust: a fill starts at zero width, and a figure starts invisible. Voting is open when the
// board arrives, and a board that showed the result before the vote closed would be lying.
