// Quiz scaffolding. Quiz graphics carry FIXED data fields (they never come from o.lines —
// the wizard's line editor doesn't apply here), sized by the board's OPTION COUNT n:
//   f0 "Question" · f1…fn "Answer A".."Answer <n-th letter>" ·
//   f(n+1) "Correct answer" (dropdown over the board's own letters) ·
//   f(n+2) "Selected answer" (the same letters, plus the un-picked "—")
//
// n is 2, 3 or 4 — a true/false board, a three-way, and the classic four-answer board are the
// SAME graphic with a different number of rows, so they share this one assembler rather than
// forking it. Everything below that could have hard-coded four (the letter alphabet, the two
// hidden field ids, the preset's row list) is derived from n instead, and n = 4 derives exactly
// the strings the four-answer board always emitted — the existing designs are byte-identical.
//
// Structure contract (shown at n = 4):
//   <div class="quiz">                 root — zone positioned; opacity:0 until play()
//     <div class="quiz-box">           the panel; presets tween this
//       <div class="quiz-mask"><span id="f0">…</span></div>      the question (mask-up reveal)
//       <div class="quiz-options">                               the n answer rows
//         <div class="quiz-option quiz-option-1">                shared look + its own identity
//           <span class="quiz-letter">A</span>                   static letter chip
//           <span id="f1">…</span>                             the answer text
//         </div>
//         …same for B/#f2, C/#f3, D/#f4 (quiz-option-2..4)…
//       </div>
//     </div>
//     hidden #f5 source SPX writes the correct letter into
//   </div>
//
// The reveal: SPX's Continue button calls next(), which plays the graphic's second step —
// the "Reveal" step, whose whole content is a lifecycle call to revealAnswer(). That reads the
// letter in #f5, marks that .quiz-option with 'quiz-correct' (accent treatment) and the other
// three with 'quiz-dim' (faded) — designs MUST style both classes. Presets tween .quiz-box and
// .quiz-option, so designs never put skew/rotation on those elements (paint it on
// ::before/::after layers).
//
// Why a CALL and not keyframes: WHICH row lights up is chosen by the operator at play time
// (field f5), so the reveal has no fixed target and no static keyframe can describe it. It is
// honestly code-owned motion — the same posture as a clock's startClock() — so the data names
// the function and the logic stays readable JS outside the marked region.
