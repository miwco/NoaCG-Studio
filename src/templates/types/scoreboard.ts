// SCOREBOARD — the type that proves the model's hardest claim, so it is worth reading as an
// argument rather than a config file.
//
// A scorebug is where a naive state machine explodes. Score, clock, possession, flag, period,
// and result are all "state" in the everyday sense, and one machine holding every combination
// of them would need hundreds of states. The model's answer is two rules working together:
//
//   1. DATA IS NOT STATE. The scores are fields. Changing one repaints a number and moves no
//      pointer anywhere — the design's own update() pops the digit, exactly as before. Nothing
//      here declares a state for "home team leads".
//   2. INDEPENDENT THINGS GET INDEPENDENT GROUPS. A flag is up or it is not; a clock runs or
//      it is held; a result is live or it is final. Three small graphs, three pointers, no
//      combinatorics — 2 + 2 + 2 states instead of 8.
//
// The main group carries no authored transitions at all: a scoreboard has no reveal sequence,
// it just comes on air and stays. Everything interesting is beside the default path, which is
// the shape the goals document's scorebug test describes.
//
// A GOAL IS AN EVENT THAT ALSO MOVES A NUMBER (owner, 2026-08-23, said twice while running a
// match: "no reason to play the goal animation if the number doesn't change"). Rule 1 still
// holds - the score is data and the flag group has no state for "home leads" - but the +1 must
// ride the SAME press as the flag, never arrive as a second update the operator has to
// remember. The control's `adjust` carries it: the surface sends the event with that side's
// score moved by one as its payload, so the machine applies the new figure exactly when it
// accepts the flag (and drops both if it does not), the command log holds the absolute score
// for recovery, and the operator's field box reads the new value the moment the flag goes up.
// Nothing in the template counts; a snap into "Flag" replays a pose and bumps nothing.
