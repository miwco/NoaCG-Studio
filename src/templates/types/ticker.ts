// TICKER — the type that has to advance BY ITSELF, which is what makes it the interesting one.
//
// The reference formats want a ticker in 8 of 60, but its real job here is to prove that a
// graphic can move without an operator: items cycle on a timer, and the operator can still
// take hold of it.
//
// Why this type is a ROTATOR and not the classic scrolling marquee: a timer arms when its
// state's entry timeline ends, and a marquee's timeline never ends (it is an endless
// repeat). Verified against GSAP directly — a call scheduled at an endless timeline's
// duration never fires — and now guarded by validateMachine, so the mistake reports itself
// rather than producing a ticker that silently sits still.
//
// So the machine IS the cycle: each beat slides one item out and the next one in with real,
// editable keyframes, and a zero-duration call advances the index. The index stays runtime
// data — never a state per item, which is the model's "parameterize with data" rule at its
// most literal. The marquee remains a catalog variant with no machine, unchanged.
