// The graphic-type registry (docs/GRAPHIC_TYPES.md).
//
// A type declares what a graphic IS; its designs are the looks it ships as. Registering one
// here is what puts its designs in the catalog — `catalog.ts` merges `typeVariants()` over the
// hand-written lists, replacing BY ID where a type promotes an existing variant, so a promoted
// design keeps its id everywhere it is already referenced (the AI's variant enum, saved
// preferences, the sweeps).
