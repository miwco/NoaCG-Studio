// ALERT LEVEL — the type whose states are the graphic's MEANING, not just its choreography.
//
// Every other type in the registry animates: a state is a pose the graphic passes through on
// its way somewhere. An alert's severity is different. The state IS the message — "this is a
// Watch, not a Warning" is the single most important thing the graphic says — and it can
// change while the graphic sits on air, several times, in either direction, driven by an
// operator who is reading a wire feed.
//
// That shape is exactly what a PARALLEL group is for (docs/STATE_MACHINE_SCHEMA.md): the
// severity runs on its own pointer, independent of where the main path is, so escalating does
// not re-run the entrance and going off air does not lose the level's own bookkeeping. The
// main group stays the ordinary linear walk every alert shares.
//
// ── Why the level change is a CUT, and not a cross-fade ──────────────────────────────────
//
// Two reasons, one editorial and one mechanical.
//
// Editorially, a severity word half-way between "Watch" and "Warning" is unreadable, and the
// half-second in which it is unreadable is the half-second a viewer is most likely to be
// looking. Broadcast warning systems cut for the same reason.
//
// Mechanically, the keyframe model applies a track's FIRST keyframe as a hard set at time 0
// (shared/animRuntime.ts buildStepTimeline). A cross-fade would therefore have to name a
// starting opacity for all four level blocks, and the only honest value for "the level we
// happen to be on" is unknowable from a per-STATE timeline — so any fade-out we authored
// would first flash three levels the graphic is not at. The cut has no such failure mode:
// each state sets its own block to 1 and the other three to 0, at time 0, always correct
// whatever the previous level was.
//
// What the states DO animate is the acknowledgement: a single short dip on the flag, so an
// operator watching the output sees that their press landed. One dip, no repeat, no strobe —
// a flashing warning graphic is an accessibility hazard (photosensitivity) long before it is
// a design choice.
//
// ── Why there is no timer here ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Severity never changes by itself. Every arrow is an operator event, which is also what
// makes the control page honest: four buttons, all four legal from every level, because an
// operator escalating or standing down is never illegal.
