// The GRAPHIC TYPE contract (docs/GRAPHIC_TYPES.md).
//
// A type says WHAT a graphic is — its structure, its fields, its state groups and default
// path, and the events an operator can send it — independently of what it looks like. A
// design says what it looks like. Phase 3's catalog is types × themes, Phase 4's node editor
// edits any type's graph, and Phase 5 generates a control page from the machine; all three
// need the type to be the thing that knows.
//
// A type is a DECLARATION, not a second way to build a template. `variantsFromType` compiles
// one into ordinary TemplateVariants that go through the category's existing assembler, so
// `variant.create(options) -> SpxTemplate` remains the single contract the wizard, the AI, the
// sweeps and every spec already speak.
//
// THE RULE THAT KEEPS THIS SMALL: persist a machine only when the derived one is wrong.
// deriveMachine already gives every template a correct one-group linear machine, so a type
// with no branches, no parallel groups and no event overrides compiles to NO machine key and
// emits exactly what it emitted before. Most types are in that class, and that is the design
// working rather than a shortcut.
