// can pause and resume — which is the cheapest honest demonstration of the model's core
// claim: state that has nothing to do with the graphic's entrance lives in its own group,
// runs alongside the default path, and never multiplies the states on it.
//
// The group's initial state is `running`, so its timeline never plays at play() (a parallel
// group's initial state is where it rests, not something it enters). The clock is started
// exactly as before, by the entrance step's own startClock call. All the group adds is the
// ability to hold it.
