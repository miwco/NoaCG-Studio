// LOWER THIRD — the most-needed graphic there is: 52 of the 60 reference formats call for
// one (anchor, guest, speaker, artist, player, pastor, candidate…). It is also the type that
// proves the model stays out of the way: one group, three states (off -> on -> out), no
// machine key at all, and the SPX Continue contract drives it with nothing else declared.
//
// Design: promotes lt11 "House Strap" unchanged — the family flagship every other house
// variant is already judged against.

      //    by a pseudo-element, so there is no accent NODE for a timeline to address) and fails
      //    semantics besides: its second line is an @handle, which is the social bug's subject;
      //  - lt10 Soft Stack has a real accent but emits three fields against this type's two.

      // paint their accent rather than placing it, and a type that names `accent` as a required
      // part cannot take any of them however well the rest lines up. lt15 keeps lt08's frosted
      // card but leads it with a real soft accent edge and holds to the two lines this type
      // declares.

    // it is named for and dropped it out of the wizard's logo-first ordering. The sport
    // lower-third cell needs a two-line design with no logo slot.
    // lt10 is NOT promotable here: this type declares two fields (name, title) and lt10 emits
    // three. A type's field count is part of its contract — the control page and the compiled
    // fN ids are built from it — so a design carrying an extra field is a different graphic,
    // not the same graphic in another skin. The glass lower-third cell needs a two-field design.
