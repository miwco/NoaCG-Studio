// LIVE VOTE — the type that has to hold a vote OPEN, and then close it.
//
// The reference data already has a `poll` type (dataBoards.ts): a finished result chart, one
// look, no arc. This is the other half of the same subject — the vote while it is happening —
// and the difference is entirely in the states:
//
//     voting ──(timer: the window runs out)──▶ closed ──▶ result ──▶ called
//        │      ──(operator: "Close voting")──▶            ▲
//        └──────────────── next / "Show result" ───────────┘
//
// TWO WAYS TO CLOSE, and that is the point. The window is a real `timer` transition — a
// `gsap.delayedCall` armed by the interpreter when the entrance timeline settles, so the bench's
// timeScale and the render pipeline's virtual clock drive it for free, and a scrubbed or settled
// board never arms one and so can never close the vote under the operator. The manual "Close
// voting" button is the same arrow drawn by hand, because on air the presenter's "that's it,
// voting is closed" is what actually ends a vote; the window is the safety net behind it.
//
// KNOWN LIMIT, stated rather than hidden: the window's length is AUTHORED data on the arrow
// (editable in the node editor, or in the JSON), not a field the operator sets per play. Timer
// transitions carry a fixed `after`, and inventing a second, field-driven clock that could
// disagree with it would be worse than saying so. Shows that need a per-play window close by
// hand — which is the button above, and the commoner workflow anyway.
//
// The WINNER is a call, not a keyframe, for the same reason the quiz's answer reveal is: which
// row wins depends on the counts the operator typed, so it has no fixed target. Everything else
// the board does — the badge leaving, the figures arriving, the bars growing — stays in
// keyframes and measured builders, which is what makes a snap straight to the result show the
// result (docs/STATE_MACHINE_SCHEMA.md §3, "Snap").
