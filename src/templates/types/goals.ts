// docs/PACK_TAXONOMY.md's gap list put "goal / progress bar" at the top by frequency — around
// eight of the sixty reference formats want one — and every one of them is the same two numbers
// (what we have, what we are aiming at) drawn a different way. That is a type, not three
// designs that happen to look similar, and the shared rebuild in
// infographics/dataRuntimes.ts is where the derivation lives once.
//
// None of these needs a state machine. A goal meter changes because its DATA changes, which is
// exactly the case the state schema says must never be a transition: `update()` writes the
// figures and the graphic re-derives itself. The only thing that moves on a timeline is the
// entrance.

/**
 * CALL TO ACTION — the strap that ASKS.
 *
 * The four asks a live programme actually makes — follow, donate, register, buy — are one
 * graphic with a different verb in it, and the reference data spreads them across different
 * formats. Making the verb a FIELD is what stops this being four near-identical designs; it is
 * the same "parameterize with data, not states" instinct the state schema applies to poses,
 * applied to content.
 *
 * It is deliberately NOT the social-handle type. A handle bug states where to find someone and
 * sits there for a whole segment; a call to action asks for something and has a reason line to
 * justify it. Same category, same prefix, different graphic — which is exactly the distinction
 * docs/GRAPHIC_TYPES.md §5's semantics gate exists to protect.

 * the derived share is drawn (a fill's data-value or an SVG ring's), which is a design
 * decision, not a different graphic.
 *
 * The measured motion is the part a keyframe cannot hold — the ring's angle and the counter's
 * target are the operator's data, so they live in named builders (infographics/igMotion.ts) and
 * the animation region only names them. `goal-ring` exists as its own preset for a reason worth
 * remembering: on a POLL ring the middle figure IS the percent, so one number drives both; on a
 * goal meter the middle figure is money and the ring is raised/goal. Reusing 'ring-fill' here
 * would draw a full ring at 3% raised.

 * "which tiers have we passed". A creator's follower tiers, a telethon's stretch goals and a

 * them, not plotted at current/max. A rail drawn as "1 → 2 → 3 → 4" has to have its line mean a
 * position on that rail, and even spacing is what keeps four labels readable when someone adds
 * a stretch goal ten times the size of the first.
