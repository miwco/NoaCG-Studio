# src/templates - the wizard catalog and template contracts

Loaded alongside the root CLAUDE.md when working in this directory. Keep it accurate. Read
docs/DESIGN_LANGUAGE.md before generating or judging templates. After template changes, run the
catalog sweep for the affected category (root CLAUDE.md, "Verifying changes").

blank.ts + the catalog, resolved through catalog.ts (CATALOG, variantsFor/variantById).

## Shared assemblers (every category builds on these)

- **shared/base.ts** - generic assembler pieces: :root vars, zones, auto-fit, runtime scaffold.
- **shared/standard.ts** - CategorySpec, assembleStandard, makeDefineVariant.
  `CategorySpec.dataRegion` is the Timeline v2 flip: when true, assembleStandard converts the
  freshly emitted legacy ANIMATION region into the NOACG_ANIM data block + interpreter through
  the parity-proven importer (blocks/animImport.ts) at create - the preset still authors the
  motion; a conversion failure keeps the legacy emit, never a broken template. Lower thirds
  are flipped (`dataRegion: true`); the other categories stay legacy until they migrate
  (docs/TIMELINE_V2_PLAN.md).
- **shared/animRuntime.ts** - the emitted ES5 interpreter (Timeline v2), identical in every
  data-driven template: reads the NOACG_ANIM literal and defines the SAME builder globals the
  whole platform depends on (buildInTimeline / buildOutTimeline / revealNextStep), so the
  simulator, wizard thumbnails, control engine, and every export work unchanged. It pre-hides
  press-revealed layers (their reveal step's first keyframe values; plain opacity 0 fallback),
  shows/hides the CSS-hidden root, fades press-revealed layers OUTSIDE the root with the exit
  (unless the Out step animates them itself), and divides every duration and keyframe time by
  `speed`. `emitAnimRegion` emits the full marked region (data header + literal +
  interpreter); `replaceRegionWithAnimData` swaps a template's region for the data-driven
  emit (the converter's writer).
- **shared/clock.ts** - countdown engine: hidden minutes field -> M:SS + `{prefix}-done` at zero;
  DOM-ready-safe.

## Categories

- **lowerThirds/** - lt01…lt13 on shared.ts (prefix 'lower-third', `dataRegion: true` - the
  first category to create as NOACG_ANIM data blocks) + animPresets.ts (9 marked-region GSAP
  presets, prefix-parameterized - they animate any category's `.{prefix}-box` structure; on a
  data category the preset's emit is converted at create, and blocks/presetApply.ts derives
  keyframes from the same emitters after).
- **infoCards/** - card01…card05 (prefix 'info-card').
- **endCredits/** - cr01…cr04 (prefix 'credits') + creditsPresets.ts (credits-roll /
  credits-pages / credits-crawl); data-driven: a hidden #f0 textarea holds "Role | Name" lines,
  template JS parses and rebuilds #credits-track, ends with logo + year (.credits-end).
- **tickers/** - tk01…tk06 (prefix 'ticker') + tickerPresets.ts (ticker-marquee / ticker-flip);
  data-driven: #f0 lines -> #ticker-track items; marquee = items rendered twice, slide one set
  width, linear repeat:-1 (seamless loop).
- **startingSoon/** - ss01…ss03 (prefix 'starting-soon', hold-loop preset: entrance + calm
  .starting-soon-pulse breathing + clock via shared/clock.ts, minutes in f2).
- **gameTimers/** - gt01…gt02 (prefix 'game-timer', type 'countdown'; timer-run pop +
  timer-line-reveal; minutes in f1; .game-timer-done styles time-up).
- **scoreboards/** - sb01…sb02 (prefix 'scoreboard'; fixed 4-field contract f0-f3 as
  scoreboard-masks so the standard presets drive them; update() pops a score's mask when it
  changes on air).
- **cornerBug/** - bug01…bug02 (prefix 'corner-bug', standard assembler, logo slot + placeholder
  mark; bug02 = house live clock via StandardDesign.runtimeExtraJs - design-owned JS emitted
  BEFORE the marked ANIMATION region, DOM-ready guarded).
- **infographics/** - ig01…ig06 (prefix 'infographic'; design owns fields + runtimeExtraJs;
  igPresets: count-up - a suffix-preserving number tween - and bars-grow over #infographic-bars
  `.infographic-bar-fill[data-value]`).
- **quiz/** - qz01 (prefix 'quiz'; f0 question, f1-f4 options, hidden f5 correct-answer dropdown;
  next() -> revealAnswer() adds .quiz-correct/.quiz-dim, update() clears the reveal).

## The :root style contract

Every template exposes `--accent`, `--text-color`, `--text-dim`, `--panel-bg`, `--font-heading`,
`--scale`. The Style panel reads/writes exactly these, swaps the marked `@font-face` block
(bundled or imported), re-anchors the root element via `zoneDecls`, and can import a font
post-creation.

## Template runtime rule

Generated template.js loads in `<head>` in exported packages - any load-time DOM work (initial
rebuild/paint) must use the DOM-ready guard pattern (see shared/clock.ts or the rebuild calls in
the credits/tickers/infographics runtimes).

## Fields & images (the broadcast field policy)

- Field types offered to users are the ones live graphics actually use: `textfield`, `textarea`,
  `number`, and **`filelist` = the image field** (SPX lists files from
  `assetfolder: './images/'`). `dropdown`/`checkbox`/`color` exist in the SPX format but are
  reserved for genuinely constrained design choices (e.g. the quiz's correct-answer dropdown) -
  don't offer them in generic field UIs.
- Every runtime writes fields through the shared `setFieldValue` helper (base.ts
  `setFieldValueJs`): text -> textContent, `<img id="fN">` -> src (an empty value hides the img
  and toggles `.has-image` on its parent so CSS can show a placeholder). Data-driven categories
  may instead keep the path in a hidden source div (credits' #f2 logo).
- Logo slots are real SPX fields: credits f2, corner bug + card03 design-owned `extraFields`
  (`StandardDesign.extraFields`, id computed after all user fields).
- The preview iframe can't resolve `images/...` paths set at runtime - preview/composeDocument.ts
  injects a MutationObserver shim that swaps known relative paths for their in-memory data URLs.
  Exported packages never include the shim.
- Asset path convention (uploads at `images/<file>`, fonts at `fonts/<file>`, one-folder zip
  layout): see src/export/CLAUDE.md.

## Easing doctrine

model/easings.ts + DESIGN_LANGUAGE §4: entrances use Out-direction curves, exits use In-direction
and run faster; Back Out for pops; Bounce/Elastic playful-only; Linear only for continuous motion
(credits rolls, ticker marquees - strictly `ease: 'none'`).

## Broadcast packages (siblings)

Graphics made in one project must read as siblings - DESIGN_LANGUAGE §8 holds the per-family
cross-category tokens (minimal / sport / glass / **noacg house** shape, type, and motion values;
noacg is the product's own on-air look, rebuilt from the brand-kit overlays). Two mechanisms
enforce it: the **project brand** (model/brand.ts, captured on every wizard Create; the wizard's
"Use current project's colors & font" toggle - off by default - re-applies palette + font via
`brandPatch`) and **sibling judging** (every new category variant is judged against its
lower-third counterpart). Custom colors enter through the wizard's Custom palette (hex/rgba +
picker); imported fonts become template assets (`fonts/<file>` data-URL) with a visible
`@font-face`, are registered via the FontFace API for the builder UI, and ship as real binaries
in the export.
