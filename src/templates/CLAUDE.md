# src/templates - the wizard catalog and template contracts

Loaded alongside the root CLAUDE.md when working in this directory. Keep it accurate. Read
docs/DESIGN_LANGUAGE.md before generating or judging templates. After template changes, run the
catalog sweep for the affected category (root CLAUDE.md, "Verifying changes").

blank.ts + the catalog, resolved through catalog.ts (CATALOG, variantsFor/variantById).

**packs.ts** - the PACK taxonomy (docs/PACK_TAXONOMY.md): a pack is a curated type-subset in a
default family, PURE CONFIG over the filled types x families matrix; the 60 reference formats
each map to exactly one pack. `scripts/factory.mjs` validates the config on every run (cells
resolve, extras exist, formats covered exactly once) - edit packs.ts and the doc together.

## Shared assemblers (every category builds on these)

- **shared/base.ts** - generic assembler pieces: :root vars, zones, auto-fit, runtime scaffold.
- **shared/standard.ts** - CategorySpec, assembleStandard, makeDefineVariant, and
  `convertToDataRegion` - the Timeline v2 flip: convert a freshly assembled template's legacy
  ANIMATION region into the NOACG_ANIM data block + interpreter through the parity-proven
  importer (blocks/animImport.ts) at create. The preset still authors the motion; only the
  marked region converts (category-owned runtime around it - score pops, clock painters -
  stays); a conversion failure keeps the legacy emit, never a broken template.
  `CategorySpec.dataRegion` triggers it inside assembleStandard; self-assembled categories
  (scoreboards, game timers, starting soon, quiz, infographics) call it directly. **EVERY category
  now creates as a data block** - the legacy region survives only in SAVED templates (see
  src/blocks/CLAUDE.md). The step-calls model
  (docs/TIMELINE_V2_PLAN.md §3b)
  carries `tl.call(startClock/stopClock)` through the conversion as step `calls`, so a countdown
  survives the flip (the clock runtime itself lives OUTSIDE the region and is untouched), and the
  loop model (gap 6) carries the ambient breath as a step `loop` (a repeating scale track) - this
  is what let STARTING SOON flip. The MEASURED-MOTION model (docs/DYNAMIC_MOTION_SCOPE.md) carries a
  `tl.add(builderName(target))` across as a step `dynamic` - this is what let TICKERS and END
  CREDITS flip (see their motion runtimes below).
  `convertToDataRegion(template, refine?)` takes an optional refinement of the imported data -
  the seam for a step the LEGACY region has no shape for, so a category can author it directly
  instead of growing a legacy step kind Phase 8 will delete. QUIZ is the one user
  (docs/TIMELINE_V2_PLAN.md §3c): its Continue reveal is a lifecycle CALL, not a reveal group,
  so it inserts a middle step `{ calls: [revealAnswer] }` before Out - which makes SPX's
  `steps: '2'` DERIVED (three steps -> one press) instead of a hard-coded value the timeline's
  steps re-sync would overwrite with '1' on the first edit, killing the reveal.
  INFO CARDS flipped last (`dataRegion: true`) - they are the standard contract's other line-based
  family, so they convert exactly like lower thirds, steps and all. Nothing blocked them but the
  spec suite they hosted, which now runs against a SAVED legacy template instead (e2e/timeline.spec.ts).
  A wrapper that needs the motion speed must read it via the shared `motionSpeed()` helper
  (base.ts `motionSpeedJs`: NOACG_ANIM.speed, else legacy animSpeed, else 1) - never the bare
  animSpeed global, which only exists inside a legacy region.
- **shared/animRuntime.ts** - the emitted ES5 interpreter (Timeline v2), identical in every
  data-driven template: reads the NOACG_ANIM literal and defines the SAME builder globals the
  whole platform depends on (buildInTimeline / buildOutTimeline / revealNextStep), so the
  simulator, wizard thumbnails, control engine, and every export work unchanged. It pre-hides
  press-revealed layers (their reveal step's first keyframe values; plain opacity 0 fallback),
  shows/hides the CSS-hidden root, fades press-revealed layers OUTSIDE the root with the exit
  (unless the Out step animates them itself), runs a `loops` track in its own repeating
  sub-timeline (repeat/yoyo/repeatDelay - the ambient breath), and divides every duration and
  keyframe time by `speed`. `emitAnimRegion` emits the full marked region (data header + literal +
  interpreter); `replaceRegionWithAnimData` swaps a template's region for the data-driven
  emit (the converter's writer).
  It also carries the **STATE MACHINE engine** (docs/STATE_MACHINE_SCHEMA.md): the version-1
  statements stay VERBATIM as the machine-less path (a template with no `machine` key runs the
  identical code it always did), and the engine adds three globals - `noacgDispatch(event,
  payload?)` (one operator event through the SERIAL queue; the flat {field: value} payload is
  applied only if the guard accepts), `noacgSnap(assignments, opts?)` (enter states INSTANTLY
  by replaying the canonical path with suppressed callbacks; `null` = every group to its
  initial, the VISUAL half of reset - the data half stays update()'s job), and
  `noacgMachineState()`. The four SPX globals stay THE lifecycle surface and become
  machine-aware INSIDE (play = reset-and-enter, next = the default-path walk, stop = the
  built-in out legal from every state), which is why no export target, transport or preview
  path changed. Timers are `gsap.delayedCall` armed by a `tl.call` at the entry timeline's end,
  never setTimeout: GSAP's callback suppression then means a settled/scrubbed graphic never
  arms one, and the bench's timeScale + the render virtual clock drive them for free.
  **THE PAIRING RULE:** `spliceAnimData` replaces only the literal, so a saved template keeps
  its FROZEN interpreter - machine-bearing data must never land under one that predates the
  engine. Check `hasMachineRuntime(js)` first and re-emit the whole region when false (the
  `hides` precedent); validateTemplate treats a mismatch as an export-blocking error.
- **shared/clock.ts** - countdown engine: hidden minutes field -> M:SS + `{prefix}-done` at zero;
  DOM-ready-safe.
- **shared/textFit.ts** - the FIT-TO-SLOT runtime for placed text lines (the imported-design
  contract): `fitPlacedText()` condenses a `data-fit="shrink"` line to its wrapper's max-width
  by reducing font-size (never by distorting the chosen typeface), floored at 55%. Design-owned
  JS emitted OUTSIDE the marked region, injected idempotently by blocks/designLayout.ts
  `ensureTextFitRuntime`; the shared `update()` calls it via an optional hook (the
  `revealNextStep` idiom). It re-fits on `document.fonts.ready` as well as DOM-ready - a
  DOM-ready-only pass measures the FALLBACK face and overflows once the real one swaps in.

## types/ - the GRAPHIC TYPE registry (docs/GRAPHIC_TYPES.md)

A **type** declares what a graphic IS - structure contract, fields, state groups and default
path, control events - independent of what it looks like; a **design** is one look. A type is a
DECLARATION, not a second way to build a template: `variantsFromType` compiles one into
ordinary TemplateVariants that go through the category assemblers below, so
`variant.create(options)` stays the single contract the wizard, the AI, the sweeps and every
spec speak. `catalog.ts` merges them with `mergeCatalog`, REPLACING BY ID, so a type that
promotes an existing variant keeps that variant's id and its slot in the browse grid.

**THE RULE:** *persist a machine only when the derived one is wrong.* `deriveMachine` already
gives every template a correct one-group linear machine, so a type with no branches, parallel
groups or event overrides compiles to NO `machine` key and emits byte-identical output. Seven
of the twelve types are in that class.

**A type declares ONE field list, which is a real limit worth knowing before reaching for one.**
A family whose field COUNT varies across its designs cannot be a single type: the factory's
fields gate compares each design's emitted count against the declaration, and rightly. Three
families in the catalog are in that class and stay hand-written variants - camera frames (2-4
fields), the sponsor strips (4 vs 6 slots) and the location cards (one has a picture slot). That
is a legitimate state, not debt to pay off in a hurry: `card04`, `vs01` and `ig01`-`ig07` have
always lived there. Optional type fields would fix it and are a change to this contract, not to
a design (docs/PACK_TAXONOMY.md, "Known limitations").

Fields are declared with LOGICAL keys and a `role` (`line` first, `logo` last - both enforced
with a throw, because the order is what keeps the compiled `fN` ids in step with the assembler
that emits them). The main group's default path is DERIVED, never declared: its length must
equal the step count, which depends on the preset and the line count. `attachMachine` puts the
compiled machine on after assembly and THROWS if it is off-shape - unlike `convertToDataRegion`
it is compiling our own declaration, so degrading would ship a control page whose buttons do
nothing.

**The trap to know:** a timer never arms on a timeline that never ends (the arming call is
scheduled at the timeline's end). A `repeat: -1` loop or a measured `dynamics` builder makes
that unreachable, so `validateMachine` errors on it. This is why the ticker type is a rotator
with its own `ticker-rotate` preset rather than the endless marquee - and, from the other side,
why the TRANSITION type's self-clear is legal: its cover is a short finite entrance.

`TypeMachine.main.edges` is the one arrow shape branches cannot express - an arrow BETWEEN two
waypoints of the default path, since a branch's edges always have the branch at one end. The
transition type is its only user (`{ waypoint: 0 } → { waypoint: -1 }`, trigger `timer`);
modelling that as a branch would have meant inventing an off-path "cleared" state duplicating
the exit, i.e. a second way to be off air.

## Categories

- **lowerThirds/** - lt01…lt57 on shared.ts (prefix 'lower-third', `dataRegion: true` - the
  first category to create as NOACG_ANIM data blocks) + animPresets.ts (the shared marked-region
  GSAP preset bank, prefix-parameterized - it animates any category's `.{prefix}-box` structure;
  on a data category the preset's emit is converted at create, and blocks/presetApply.ts derives
  keyframes from the same emitters after). The bank leads with the **Slide family**
  (`makeSlidePreset`: slide-up/-down/-left/-right - one choreography, four directions of travel,
  ids adjacent + `SLIDE_FAMILY`/`isSlidePreset` so pickers group them: the wizard renders ONE
  Slide card with a direction picker, the Inspector one optgroup), then line-reveal, mask-wipe,
  pop-spring, snap-stinger, blur-in, fade, flip-3d.
- **infoCards/** - card01…card49 (prefix 'info-card', `dataRegion: true`). The standard contract's
  other line-based family: they use the same 9-preset bank as lower thirds and convert exactly like
  them, steps and all (a » press per body line becomes a middle step with its `reveals`). It is
  also where the COMMERCE cards live (product / offer / listing / QR / location / sponsor
  strips), which is why `shared/standard.ts` exports **`maskLine`/`maskLines`** beside
  `lineMasksFor`: the generic name/title/extra ladder gives every line past the second the same
  class, and a card whose lines are a product name, a price and a struck-through was-price needs
  to name each one for what it is. Values that could vary by shop, currency or format are FIELDS
  and vanish with `:empty` when blank (the savings chip, the promo code, the deadline, the status
  line, the unit mark) - no state, nothing for a replay to leak.
- **endCredits/** - cr01…cr04 (prefix 'credits') + creditsPresets.ts (credits-roll /
  credits-pages / credits-crawl) + **creditsMotion.ts**; data-driven: a hidden #f0 textarea holds
  "Role | Name" lines, template JS parses and rebuilds #credits-track, ends with logo + year
  (.credits-end). DATA BLOCKS via convertToDataRegion.
- **tickers/** - tk01…tk06 (prefix 'ticker') + tickerPresets.ts (ticker-marquee / ticker-flip) +
  **tickerMotion.ts**; data-driven: #f0 lines -> #ticker-track items; marquee = items rendered
  twice, slide one set width, linear repeat:-1 (seamless loop). DATA BLOCKS via convertToDataRegion.

### The category MOTION RUNTIMES (tickerMotion.ts / creditsMotion.ts / igMotion.ts)

These categories move by magnitudes that only exist once the operator's DATA is in the DOM: a
marquee slides exactly one track-width, a roll covers its own content height, a flip runs one
segment per item, a stat counts to the figure they typed, a bar grows to its own `data-value`, a
list cascades one row per line they wrote. No static keyframe can hold a number that changes the
moment the data does - which is why these were the last categories on the legacy patchers.

The fix (docs/DYNAMIC_MOTION_SCOPE.md): each measured motion is a named BUILDER - a plain function
that measures the DOM and RETURNS a GSAP object - emitted OUTSIDE the marked ANIMATION region, in
the design-owned runtime, exactly like shared/clock.ts. The preset's region does not inline the
math; it just calls it: `tl.add(tickerMarquee('#ticker-track'))`. Consequences, all load-bearing:

- the region stays fully PARSEABLE, so the ordinary importer converts it (the segment becomes a step
  `dynamic`) - ONE choreography source, no second code path;
- the builders survive the conversion and the export untouched (they're outside the markers);
- **every builder of a category ships in every template of it**, so swapping the motion preset is a
  pure data edit (one `build` name) with nothing outside the markers rewritten;
- the speed knob is read through `motionSpeed()`, never the region's `animSpeed`;
- a builder takes `(target, opts)` - `opts` is `{speed, ease}` from the interpreter (absent when the
  LEGACY emit calls it, so always default), and it may compose other builders (igMotion's count-up
  adds the bar growth once the figure lands). Give a `tl.add()` an EXPLICIT position when the phase
  has more than one: a segment is zero-advance in the importer's clock but a real child in GSAP's,
  so a bare `'-=N'` after one would resolve differently in the two.

Adding a measured motion to another category = add a builder to its runtime + have the preset
`tl.add()` it. Do NOT inline measured math in a region: it makes the template unconvertible.
- **startingSoon/** - ss01…ss03 (prefix 'starting-soon', hold-loop preset: entrance + calm
  .starting-soon-pulse breathing + clock via shared/clock.ts, minutes in f2). DATA BLOCKS via
  convertToDataRegion (self-assembled, calls it directly): the breath imports as a looping scale
  track (gap 6) and startClock/stopClock ride the step calls (§3b); the clock runtime stays
  outside the region.
- **gameTimers/** - gt01…gt04 (prefix 'game-timer', type 'countdown'; data blocks via
  convertToDataRegion; timer-run pop + timer-line-reveal; minutes in f1; .game-timer-done
  styles time-up). The preset's startClock()/stopClock() ride the conversion as step `calls`
  (§3b); the clock runtime (shared/clock.ts) stays outside the region. gt03/gt04 are the AI
  benchmark's kids-timer winners ported onto the contract: design-owned ring/tick runtimes
  via `GameTimerDesign.runtimeExtraJs` (outside the region, following the clock's globals)
  and `GameTimerDesign.autoEase` (a design's hand-tuned default ease pair, used only when
  the wizard easing is 'auto' - an explicit pick still wins).
- **scoreboards/** - sb01…sb02 (prefix 'scoreboard', data blocks via convertToDataRegion;
  fixed 4-field contract f0-f3 as scoreboard-masks so the standard presets drive them;
  update() pops a score's mask when it changes on air - speed via motionSpeed()).
- **cornerBug/** - bug01…bug02 (prefix 'corner-bug', standard assembler, `dataRegion: true`,
  logo slot + placeholder mark; bug02 = house live clock via StandardDesign.runtimeExtraJs -
  design-owned JS emitted BEFORE the marked ANIMATION region, DOM-ready guarded, survives the
  data conversion untouched).
- **infographics/** - ig01…ig25 (prefix 'infographic'; design owns fields + runtimeExtraJs) +
  igPresets (count-up / bars-grow / ring-fill / rows-cascade / **goal-ring** / **milestone-run**)
  + **igMotion.ts** + **dataRuntimes.ts** (the rebuilds several designs of a type share:
  schedule rows, bar rows, the GOAL meter in its two drawn shapes, the MILESTONE track).
  `goal-ring` is its own preset and `infographicGoalRing` its own builder for a reason: on a
  poll ring the middle figure IS the percent, so one number drives both; on a goal meter the
  figure is money and the ring is raised/goal, and feeding the raised total to `ring-fill`
  would clamp it and draw a full ring at 3 % raised. The milestone track spaces its nodes
  EVENLY and interpolates the line BETWEEN them rather than plotting current/max - a rail
  drawn "1 → 2 → 3 → 4" has to have its line mean a position on that rail, and even spacing is
  what keeps four labels readable when a stretch goal is ten times the first. DATA BLOCKS via
  convertToDataRegion. EVERY infographic's motion is MEASURED - the stat counts to the figure the
  operator typed, each bar grows to its own `data-value`, the ring draws to that percent, and the
  cascade runs one row per line they wrote - so none of it is a number a keyframe can hold, and it
  all lives in the category motion runtime (see below). The region keeps only the panel entrance
  (real, editable keyframes) and NAMES the measured part. A count-up design may or may not pair a
  progress bar with its figure, so `PresetConfig.hasBars` tells the preset - without it a bar-less
  design (ig01) would carry a phantom timeline layer for an element it doesn't have.
- **versus/** - vs01…vs02 (prefix 'versus', type 'fullscreen', SELF-ASSEMBLED like scoreboards;
  fixed field contract f0/f1 team names, f2 event line, f3/f4 logo filelists with visible
  placeholder marks; steps '1' - the sides are simultaneous) + vsPresets.ts (vs-slam /
  vs-glide: edges-meet slides + a VS pop, real keyframes only, DATA BLOCKS via
  convertToDataRegion). Born from the AI benchmark's versus-card winners - the full-frame
  match-up that once misfitted the info-card contract (dropped card05) now owns its contract.
- **importedDesign/** - imp01 (prefix 'imported-design', NOT browsable - the wizard's "Import
  graphic" entry is its only way in; CategoryInfo.group 'imported'). The wizard creates it
  BARE (an explicitly empty `lines` array, honoured by resolveOptions; the HTML/CSS carry
  teaching comments where fields will land) and hands off to the editor's Data tab - the
  assembler still renders explicit lines for a caller that passes them. The user's own flat artwork
  IS the design: `.imported-design-box` holds the `<img>` art + per-line `#fwN` mask wrappers
  (position, in the artwork's own px) around `#fN` spans (per-line type: font/size/weight/color -
  LineSpec.style). Self-assembled from shared/base.ts, NOT assembleStandard: the auto-fit
  `width: fit-content` cap would shrink frame-sized artwork (the box takes the artwork's width;
  frame-sized art anchors at 0,0, cropped art gets a zone). designPresets.ts (design-fade/
  slide/pop/blur) animates ONLY the box - artwork and text as one unit; the line presets would
  tear text out of artwork drawn around it. Steps forced off. The `#fwN` rules are the canvas
  placement drag's contract (blocks/designLayout.ts, which also owns addPlacedLine - the Data
  panel's add-field emitting a new line in this exact shape); `.imported-design-art` is its own
  registry part ("Artwork"), so the PNG and each line animate independently after creation
  (per-layer presets retarget the box motion - blocks/presetApply.ts). SCALING MODE is
  per-graphic (DesignArt.stretch, chosen in the wizard's Prepare step): fixed (default -
  byte-identical emit to before the mode existed) or horizontal 9-SLICE stretch, where the art
  becomes a border-image div - source/slice/cap-widths all in the `.imported-design-art` RULE
  (the image ref must stay a CSS declaration, never an inline style: the editor's entrance
  reset clears inline styles) - plus the stretch runtime (importedDesign/stretch.ts,
  design-owned JS outside the marked region): ONE `--stretch-x` custom property drives the box
  width, the middle band, and every [data-stretch] slot; the ladder is stretch to 4% inside
  the frame edge, then textFit shrink, then clip. The packaged SPX css hops bucket urls to ../
  (spxStarter cssForSubfolder; zip import strips the hop back). Contract + diagnosis:
  docs/IMPORT_MVP.md; E2E: e2e/import-graphic.spec.ts + e2e/import-prepare.spec.ts +
  e2e/import-stretch.spec.ts.
- **frames/** - fr01…fr04 (prefix 'frame', type 'frame', SELF-ASSEMBLED like infographics: the
  DESIGN owns its fields, because a frame's field count follows its camera count - 2 lines for
  one camera, 4 for a two-up) + framePresets.ts (frame-draw / frame-fade / frame-slide). The one
  category that is not a panel of words: it is chrome around a HOLE, so `.frame-window`
  interiors stay transparent, the stage is `pointer-events: none`, and every design states its
  window rectangles in 1080p design px in its own header (that geometry IS the contract with the
  switcher). A split design repeats `.frame-window` / `.frame-plate` so ONE preset drives one
  camera or four - the trade is that a repeated class is not a unique selector, so an individual
  window is not a registry part (root, stage and every text line are).
- **transitions/** - tr01…tr04 (prefix 'transition', type 'transition', self-assembled) +
  transitionPresets.ts (transition-slam / -wipe / -sweep). **THE ENTRANCE COVERS THE FRAME AND
  HOLDS THERE** - that hold is the cut point, so every preset's entrance ends at full cover and
  every exit takes the cover off the OTHER side (a transition that faded up and down in place
  would expose the cut). The panels are authored AT their covering position in CSS, so a
  thumbnail or a baseline still captures the cover moment. What clears it is the transition
  TYPE's machine (types/transitions.ts): a `timer` arrow from the entrance waypoint straight to
  the exit plus `exitOnNext`. **No preset schedules anything** - a setTimeout in a template is
  motion the timeline cannot see, the control page cannot pause and the render clock cannot
  drive.
- **quiz/** - qz01 (prefix 'quiz'; f0 question, f1-f4 options, hidden f5 correct-answer dropdown).
  DATA BLOCKS via convertToDataRegion + a refinement (§3c above): the Continue reveal is a real
  middle step that CALLS revealAnswer() (adds .quiz-correct/.quiz-dim + pops the winner;
  update() clears the reveal). Each answer ROW carries `quiz-option` (the shared look) AND
  `quiz-option-N` (its own animation identity) - the entrance staggers the four, and a stagger
  lives in the keyframe model as per-row start times, which one class matching four elements
  cannot carry. The numbered rows are registry parts, labelled by their field ("Answer B").

## The :root style contract

Every template exposes `--accent`, `--text-color`, `--text-dim`, `--panel-bg`, `--font-heading`,
`--scale`, `--type-scale`. The Style panel reads/writes exactly these, swaps the marked
`@font-face` block (bundled or imported), re-anchors the root element via `zoneDecls`, and can
import a font post-creation. **Two size knobs:** every dimension is authored as
`calc(Npx * var(--scale))` (whole-graphic size; resolution is folded into `--scale` by
`computeScale`), and font sizes additionally multiply by `var(--type-scale)` (text-only size,
a raw multiplier — S 0.9 · M 1 · L 1.15). Nothing but `font-size` consumes `--type-scale`.
EXCEPTION: an imported design declares NO `--type-scale` (`rootVarsCss(..., { typeScale:
false })`) — each placed line sizes itself from its own rule, and the Style panel keys its
"Text size" section on the var's presence, so declaring it would show a dead knob.

## Template runtime rule

Generated template.js loads in `<head>` in exported packages - any load-time DOM work (initial
rebuild/paint) must use the DOM-ready guard pattern (see shared/clock.ts or the rebuild calls in
the credits/tickers/infographics runtimes).

## Fields & images (the broadcast field policy)

- Field types offered to users are the ones live graphics actually use: `textfield`, `textarea`,
  `number`, and **`filelist` = the image field** (SPX lists files from
  `assetfolder: './images/'`). `dropdown`/`checkbox`/`color` exist in the SPX format but are
  reserved for genuinely constrained design choices (e.g. the quiz's correct-answer dropdown) -
  don't offer them in generic field UIs.
- Every runtime writes fields through the shared `setFieldValue` helper (base.ts
  `setFieldValueJs`): text -> textContent, `<img id="fN">` -> src (an empty value hides the img
  and toggles `.has-image` on its parent so CSS can show a placeholder). Data-driven categories
  may instead keep the path in a hidden source div (credits' #f2 logo).
- Logo slots are real SPX fields, declared as a VARIANT CAPABILITY
  (`TemplateVariant.logo: 'none' | 'optional' | 'built-in'`): built-in designs (corner bugs,
  credits' f2) always carry their slot; 'optional' designs get the wizard's Fields-step logo
  toggle + custom upload and only emit the field when it's on (`ResolvedOptions.logoEnabled`).
  A design either hand-authors its slot (lt07's badge, lt08's docked square, card03) as
  design-owned `extraFields` (id computed after all user fields), or opts in with zero code:
  `shared/logoSlot.ts` `applyLogoSlot` injects the standard slot (filelist field +
  `<img id="fN" class="{prefix}-logo">` leading the box + placeholder CSS) from
  `assembleStandard` when `logoEnabled` and `designHasLogoSlot` says the design has none.
- The preview iframe can't resolve `images/...` paths set at runtime - preview/composeDocument.ts
  injects a MutationObserver shim that swaps known relative paths for their in-memory data URLs.
  Exported packages never include the shim.
- Asset path convention (uploads at `images/<file>`, fonts at `fonts/<file>`, one-folder zip
  layout): see src/export/CLAUDE.md.

## Easing doctrine

model/easings.ts + DESIGN_LANGUAGE §4: entrances use Out-direction curves, exits use In-direction
and run faster; Back Out for pops; Bounce/Elastic playful-only; Linear only for continuous motion
(credits rolls, ticker marquees - strictly `ease: 'none'`).

## Broadcast packages (siblings)

Graphics made in one project must read as siblings - DESIGN_LANGUAGE §8 holds the per-family
cross-category tokens (minimal / sport / glass / **noacg house** shape, type, and motion values;
noacg is the product's own on-air look, rebuilt from the brand-kit overlays). Two mechanisms
enforce it: the **project brand** (model/brand.ts, captured on every wizard Create; the wizard's
"Use current project's colors & font" toggle - off by default - re-applies palette + font via
`brandPatch`) and **sibling judging** (every new category variant is judged against its
lower-third counterpart). Custom colors enter through the wizard's Custom palette (hex/rgba +
picker); imported fonts become template assets (`fonts/<file>` data-URL) with a visible
`@font-face`, are registered via the FontFace API for the builder UI, and ship as real binaries
in the export.
