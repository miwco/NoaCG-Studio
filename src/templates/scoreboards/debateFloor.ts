// The DEBATE FLOOR's shared parts: the field contract, and the two-clock engine that runs it.
//
// It lives beside the boards rather than in the type, because a field list and a runtime are
// things a DESIGN emits — but the speaking-timer TYPE has to declare exactly the same fields it
// will compile against, and two hand-kept copies of one contract is how they come to disagree.
// So the contract is declared once here in the type's own `TypeField` vocabulary, the type
// spreads it, and the design compiles it to SPX DataFields through `typeFieldsToSpx`.
//
// The import points scoreboards/ -> types/graphicType.ts, which is a leaf: it reaches into
// model/ and blocks/ and never back into templates/, so there is no cycle to boot into.

/**
 * The debate floor's ten fields.
 *
 * The ORDER is load-bearing twice over. `typeFieldsToSpx` numbers them f0..f9 in declaration
 * order and throws if a `line` field follows a non-line one; and the animation presets
 * choreograph `#f0 … #f{lineCount-1}`, so every field with a visible span has to come before
 * the one that does not. The penalty size is therefore last: it is the only value nothing
 * paints.
 *
 * WHY THE CLOCKS ARE FIELDS the operator can type into: the same reason the match clock is
 * (shared/matchClock.ts). A speaking clock drifts from the chair's stopwatch, and a clock that
 * cannot be corrected is one the chair stops trusting. Typing a time re-anchors the count.

 * `resetClocks` when the chair re-arms, `applyPenalty` / `clearPenaltyMark` for a docked speaker,
 * `holdClocks` on the way off air.
 *
 * TICKING IS DISPLAY, NOT STATE — the same rule the match clock states (matchClock.ts §4). The
 * running count is a DEADLINE recomputed every tick rather than a counter decremented once a
 * second, so a late or coalesced interval is self-correcting instead of cumulative and a
 * five-minute speech still ends at 00:00 in a throttled background tab.
 *
 * THE DEADLINE IS ANCHORED TO THE EVENT, not to this browser. `debateNow()` reads the instant
 * the operator event actually happened — the log row's own server time, which every renderer of
 * a production sees identically (control/controlModel.ts). Two browser sources handed the same
 * `switch` row therefore paint the same second however far apart they received it, and a
 * renderer replaying a missed row resumes the speech from where it really started rather than
 * from the moment it caught up.
 *
 * THE RUNNING CLOCK'S VALUE ON THE WIRE IS ORIGIN-STAMPED, exactly as the single match clock's
 * is (`"03:12@<epoch>"`, control/matchClockWire.ts). It has to be: a renderer that rebuilds from
 * a report snapshot taken AFTER the switch it needed has no row left to replay, and a plain time
 * would put the field's last written value on air mid-speech. `speakingClockUpdate` below is
 * this engine's half of that — the same three-way reading the match clock's `matchClockUpdate`
 * makes, over two clocks instead of one.
 *
 * WHICH of the two is running is not asked of the machine. **The stamp IS the pointer**: at most
 * one clock field carries one, and that one is running. The wire keeps that invariant without
 * reading a state graph (the argument is in matchClockWire.ts), and this engine reads it back
 * the same way. `data-speaking="a" | "b" | "allowance" | "penalty"` on the design's own markup
 * is the whole contract between them.
