// TEMPLATE PACKS — the taxonomy axis of the types × themes catalog (docs/PACK_TAXONOMY.md).
//
// A pack is a CURATED SUBSET of graphic types in a fitting style family: the answer to "I run
// a church stream / an esports night / an election program — which graphics do I need?". The
// 60 reference formats in live_format_graphics_needs.xlsx each map to exactly one pack, and
// that mapping IS the taxonomy document's machine-readable half.
//
// A pack is PURE CONFIG, and that is the point (Phase 3's "catalog growth is a config change"):
// across the PRODUCTION families every (type, family) cell already has a shipped, gate-checked
// design, so declaring a pack requires no new template work — `resolvePack` just looks the
// cells up in the live registry. A NEW pack is one entry in this array. A new THEME is
// deliberately NOT config: it needs twelve designs and a FAMILY_TOKENS row before a pack could
// point at it, and `validatePacks` would say so.
//
// **"The matrix is full" is true of FOUR families, not six** — and as of 2026-08-08 those four
// are genuinely full: every registered type ships a noacg, minimal, sport and glass design, so
// every pack below resolves in all four looks. Before that day, seventeen of twenty-one did
// (docs/KIT_MATRIX_GAPS.md measured it; ten designs closed the gap).
//
// Editorial and cinematic cover 6 and 5 types. They are real STYLE families — their own designs,
// FAMILY_TOKENS row and Browse chip — but they are BROWSE families, not KIT families: almost no
// graphic TYPE ships a design in them, so no pack resolves into either. That is a deliberate
// state, not debt: filling them means ~118 new designs each, and a kit is not the only thing a
// style family is for. Anything resolving a pack must therefore MEASURE which families work
// (`familiesFor` in wizard/steps/KitPicker.tsx) rather than assume all six do.
//
// `scripts/factory.mjs` validates all of this on every run: every type id resolves, every
// extra exists in the catalog, and the 60 formats are covered exactly once. Editing this file
// cannot silently break the taxonomy.
//
// One limit worth knowing: the cell check (`validatePacks`) only tests each pack's OWN
// declared `family`. It says nothing about the other five, which is why the gate stayed green
// the whole time the header above claimed six families' worth of cells were filled. The
// factory's own probe has always counted "12 types x 4 families" — the two disagreed, and the
// header was the wrong one.
