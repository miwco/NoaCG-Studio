// TEMPLATE PACKS — the taxonomy axis of the types × themes catalog (docs/PACK_TAXONOMY.md).
//
// A pack is a CURATED SUBSET of graphic types in a fitting style family: the answer to "I run
// a church stream / an esports night / an election program — which graphics do I need?". The
// 60 reference formats in live_format_graphics_needs.xlsx each map to exactly one pack, and
// that mapping IS the taxonomy document's machine-readable half.
//
// A pack is PURE CONFIG, and that is the point (Phase 3's "catalog growth is a config change"):
// because the type × family matrix is full, every (type, family) cell already has a shipped,
// gate-checked design, so declaring a pack requires no new template work — `resolvePack` just
// looks the cells up in the live registry. A NEW pack is one entry in this array. A new THEME
// is deliberately NOT config: it needs twelve designs and a FAMILY_TOKENS row before a pack
// could point at it, and `validatePacks` would say so.
//
// `scripts/factory.mjs` validates all of this on every run: every type id resolves, every
// cell is filled, every extra exists in the catalog, and the 60 formats are covered exactly
// once. Editing this file cannot silently break the taxonomy.
