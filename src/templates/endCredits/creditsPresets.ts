// End-credits motion presets. Same marked-region + knob contract as every category
// (animSpeed / easeIn / easeOut), but the travel itself is LINEAR (ease: 'none') per the
// easing doctrine — continuous motion never eases. animSpeed scales the travel speed.
//
// The credits structure contract (see shared.ts):
//   .credits (root, opacity:0) → .credits-box (viewport, overflow hidden)
//     → #credits-track (rows injected by rebuildCredits())
// The end of the track is the .credits-end block (logo placeholder + year).
//
// The box's fade is ordinary keyframeable motion and lives here. The TRAVEL is not: a roll
// covers its own content height, a crawl its own width, a page swap runs one segment per
// page — all measured from the operator's text. So the region does not inline that code — it
// calls a named builder from creditsMotion.ts (emitted outside the region) and adds what it
// returns. That keeps the region fully parseable, which is what lets these templates be data
// blocks with a read-only "measured motion" segment on the timeline
// (docs/DYNAMIC_MOTION_SCOPE.md).
