// End-credits scaffolding. Credits are data-driven: ONE textarea field (f0) holds the whole
// credit list — a line ending in a colon is a role, every line beneath it is one of that
// role's names, "# Heading" opens a department, a blank line starts a new section — and f1
// holds the year/copyright line. The template's JS parses that text into rows at runtime, so
// the whole list is pasted and edited in the playout client, with no field per person and no
// code touched. The full rule set is on parseCredits below, and in docs/END_CREDITS.md.
//
// Structure contract:
//   <div class="credits">                 root — positioned by zone; opacity:0 until play()
//     <div class="credits-box">           the viewport (overflow hidden); presets fade this
//       <div id="credits-track">          rows injected by rebuildCredits()
//     </div>
//     hidden #f0 / #f1 sources SPX writes into (and #f2 when the design takes a logo)
//   </div>
// Every track ends with the .credits-end block: the year, and the mark if the design takes one.
//
// The logo is a VARIANT CAPABILITY, not a category fixture (`TemplateVariant.logo`, resolved
// into `o.logoEnabled`). A design that declares 'none' emits no f2 field, no hidden source and
// no logo lookup — the operator's control page then shows exactly the fields the graphic can
// actually use. renderEndBlock's second argument is `null` for the whole life of such a design.
