// cr13 "Programme Roll" - the credits set the way a printed theatre programme sets them: a serif
// page, and every credit a ROW - role on the left, name on the right, a dotted leader between
// them. The credits sibling of lt59 and card80 (docs/DESIGN_LANGUAGE.md §8, editorial family).
//
// Two things make it a different graphic rather than a re-skin of cr01, and both are measured
// absences (docs/CATALOG_VARIETY.md §3):
//   - it is set in a serif, on paper. Zero of 459 designs were, though two serifs ship bundled
//     (absence 1), and every design in the catalog was drawn for light text on a dark surface
//     (absence 5). The category's programme background is category-owned CSS emitted BEFORE a
//     design's own, which is the seam this design repaints the surface through.
//   - no capitals are forced anywhere on it, and there is ONE font weight on the whole page.
//     A printed programme sets its headings and its role labels in roman and lets tracking and
//     colour carry them, and a single-weight text serif carries a page on size alone; 88.5% of
//     the catalog shouting somewhere in uppercase (absence 3) and its two-or-three-weight mode
//     are what make both worth spending a design on. ss18 makes the same two decisions, so the
//     two read as one printed package.
//   - the ROW itself. Every credits design in the catalog stacks the role above the name or sets
//     them in two fixed columns; a leader row is how a printed programme, a concert bill and a
//     book's front matter have set the same information for two centuries, and it reads
//     completely differently on air - the eye tracks along the line rather than down a stack.
//
// The leader is drawn by the ROW BUILDER, which is where a design's markup belongs: the parser
// hands back the same three entry kinds it hands every other design, and all three are answered.
