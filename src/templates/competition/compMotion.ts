// The competition pack's MEASURED motion — the magnitudes a keyframe cannot hold.
//
// A results board cascades one row per team the operator typed; a comparison grows each bar to
// its own figure; a bracket walks one column per round. None of those counts exist until the
// data is in the DOM (docs/DYNAMIC_MOTION_SCOPE.md), so each is a named BUILDER: a plain
// function that measures the DOM and returns a GSAP object. The animation data only names it
// (`"dynamics": [{ "build": "compCascade", … }]`) and the interpreter adds what it returns.
//
// These ship OUTSIDE the marked ANIMATION region — design-owned runtime, like the countdown
// clock — so the timeline never rewrites them and they survive every export untouched. Every
// builder ships in every competition template: the data names the live one, so swapping the
// motion preset is a pure data edit.
