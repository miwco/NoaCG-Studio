// card15 "In Memoriam" — the memorial card: one person, their years, and a line about them.
// Minimal family, sibling of card07 (Clean Title) and cr11 (Roll of Remembrance), which is the
// same job done as a list.
//
// The restraint here is deliberate and total. No panel, no keyline, no glow, no accent bar —
// the only colour on the card is one hairline under the name, and even that is softened. The
// name is set light rather than bold: weight reads as emphasis, and emphasis on a memorial
// card reads as promotion.
//
// The years are tabular so a sequence of these cards has its dates in the same place every
// time — which matters when a broadcast runs several in a row.
