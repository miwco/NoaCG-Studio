// The SPECIALIST lower-third pack — designs drawn for ONE production rather than for any
// show (see ./shared.ts for what that means and why it is a pack rather than more lt* files).
//
// They are ordinary lower thirds in every mechanical sense: same category, same assembler,
// same preset bank, same export path — and they carry no discovery metadata of their own.
// Browse facets and search come from the ONE taxonomy (model/taxonomy.ts via
// templates/templateMeta.ts), so these are declared there exactly like every other design.
//
// Ordered by production, not by style — the order someone browsing for their own show reads
// the grid in. Within a production the designs are genuinely different graphics, not restyles
// of one: each file's header argues what its composition claims that its siblings' do not.
