// SVG import — parse, sanitize and inventory a dropped SVG file (docs/SVG_IMPORT_PLAN.md).
//
// The promise this module serves: a layered SVG from Illustrator, Figma or Inkscape imported
// VERBATIM is the user's exact graphic; binding its own <text> nodes to data fields makes it a
// playable template. So this module never redraws, reflows or prettifies anything — it parses
// with DOMParser, removes only what the sanitizer must (script, event handlers, foreignObject,
// external references, SMIL), tags each bindable text node with a data-noacg-candidate marker,
// and serializes ONCE. Everything downstream — the mapping step's highlight, the generator's
// id="fN" binding — addresses nodes through those markers, so the artwork itself is never
// touched again.
//
// WHY the sanitizer is here and not only in the validation gate: an imported SVG is untrusted
// input entering srcdoc previews, exports and (later) community sharing. The gate
// (validation/validateTemplate.ts) stays authoritative — it re-checks the emitted template —
// but the import must hand clean markup to the preview in the first place.

 * answer. Inkscape defaults new documents to millimetres and every print-first tool (Affinity,
 * CorelDRAW) defaults to millimetres or points, so a full 1280 × 720 page arrives as
 * `width="338.66666mm" viewBox="0 0 338.66666 190.5"` — the same numbers twice, because the

 * on the frame as a postage stamp (sweep finding 3, docs/backlog/svg-import-sweep-findings.md).

 * "responsive SVG" edit that leaves `width="100%"` on a file WITH a viewBox was always fine and
 * still is (the viewBox answers); the same edit on a file with NO viewBox used to import at
 * 100 × 100 — a nineteen-fold error reported as a plausible size — and is now refused by the

 * animRuntime.ts) runs `clearProps: 'all'` over the whole root subtree - that is how a snap puts
 * an animated graphic back to its CSS rest, and it is why this area's contract already says
 * "classes, never inline styles" for the drawn states. It cannot tell an animation's leftover
 * transform from a declaration the designer wrote, so anything inline is gone the first time the
 * graphic is reset, snapped or parked.
 *
 * Illustrator and Figma survive that by accident: with "Internal CSS" (or Figma's presentation
 * attributes) their typography is already in a `<style>` block or on attributes. INKSCAPE puts
 * ALL of it inline - `style="font-size:56px;font-family:Archivo;fill:#ffffff;letter-spacing:2px"`
 * on every `<text>`, and nothing anywhere else - so an Inkscape lower third lost its type, its
 * weights and its colours the moment the editor parked it: three layers drawn at 56, 30 and 22px
 * all painted at the browser's default 16 in the fallback face. Measured 2026-09-01 on
 * `inkscape-lower-third-layers`, which the exporter sweep had passed as clean because nothing
 * had ever looked at the rendered TYPE.
 *
 * One class per distinct declaration block, in a `<style>` appended LAST, so it outranks every
 * SINGLE-CLASS rule in the file - which is the only kind Illustrator, Figma and Inkscape write,
 * and the reason this draws the same as the inline attribute it replaces. It does NOT outrank an
 * id or a compound selector, so a hand-edited stylesheet carrying one of those would now win
 * where the inline declaration used to; no exporter emits either. Specificity stays under an
 * inline style, which is what the fit ladder writes when it sizes a line - so the runtime still
 * wins, and now the design survives underneath it.
 *
 * The root `<svg>` keeps its own attribute: it carries the exporter's `enable-background`
 * bookkeeping, never a layer's look, and it is one element rather than every element.
 *
 * THIS IS THE SHALLOWER OF TWO FIXES. The deeper one is for the reset to clear only the
 * properties the animation actually wrote, rather than every inline property on the subtree -
 * which would serve every template family and not only imported artwork. That lives in
 * templates/shared/animRuntime.ts and is nobody's to change from here.

 *
 * Illustrator writes one tspan per LINE of a multi-line block; one tspan per KERNED RUN whenever
 * the type carries tracking or manual kerning, several of them on ONE baseline; and one tspan per
 * label when a designer places two labels APART on one baseline (a strap's place and its time).
 * Treating every run as a field turned one headline into three ("A" / "lexandra" / " Riva").
 * Treating every shared baseline as one field merged "Helsinki" and "22:40" into one unusable
 * field.
 *
 * WHAT IS ONE FIELD (owner, 2026-09-01, on a quiz board whose question arrived as three boxes):
 * "A semantic text item such as a question should normally remain one field, with NoaCG handling
 * wrapping, resizing or layout adaptation." So the two axes answer differently:
 *
 *   - DOWN the page, stacked lines of ONE `<text>` are ONE WRAPPING FIELD. A designer pressing
 *     Return twice inside one text object drew one question, not three; the breaks they typed are
 *     where the words happened to fall at the size they drew at, and NoaCG owns that decision
 *     from here (docs/SVG_AUTHORING.md §3, and the ladder in §4). Two `<text>` OBJECTS are still
 *     two fields, whatever they look like - separate objects is the designer saying so.
 *   - ACROSS the baseline the GAP still decides. Runs of one line sit flush against each other -
 *     the next one starts about where the previous one ended - while two placed labels sit a real
 *     distance apart. `groupLine` estimates where each run ends and starts a new SEGMENT only
 *     when the next `x` is more than an em past that.
 *
 * The estimate assumes start-anchored runs, which is the idiom Illustrator's kerning writes.
 * It is deliberately generous: merging two labels a designer meant to keep apart costs them a
 * field, while splitting a kerned headline costs them their headline.
 *
 * A `<text>` that has BOTH - several baselines and a gapped baseline among them - is a composed
 * block (a two-column table typed as one object), and wrapping is meaningless there. That one
 * falls back to the old reading: every segment its own field. It is the rare case, and the rule
 * above is the one that is stated in the docs.

 * runtime repaints it at its own leading on the first fit, which is what "NoaCG handles the
 * wrapping" means.
 *
 * A line made of SEVERAL kerned runs cannot be stamped - the stamp is per line, and marking each
 * run would put a space inside a word - so that block is FLATTENED to its one value instead. It
 * loses the hand kerning, which no wrapping block can keep anyway: the moment the words move,
 * the kerning the designer set for their old positions is wrong. The same goes for a line that
 * is not a DIRECT child of the `<text>`: the runtime reads a block off `el.children`, so a line
 * parked inside a wrapper tspan would be stamped here and not recognised there, which is both
 * failures the stamp exists to prevent, arriving silently.
 *
 * NEITHER path touches a `<text>` holding a `<textPath>`. Flattening one would delete the curve
 * the designer drew - the same loss `textCandidates` guards a single textPath against at
 * update() time, and there is no wrapping to be had along a path anyway.
 *
 * A single-line `<text>` is never touched, kerned runs and all: those tspans are the artwork
 * arriving verbatim (src/templates/importedDesign/AGENTS.md), and there is nothing to re-wrap.

  // the id resolves to the same element in either role, while a second marker on the element
  // would have to be a list and would break every one of those selectors. Uniqueness is
  // unchanged - an id is minted once per element, never per role - and the two roles bind
  // different NODES anyway: growth stamps the rect, the picture field takes the id of the
  // `<image>` the pattern resolves to (templates/importedDesign/svg.ts). What the surfaces do owe
  // this is to stop assuming a candidate id appears in exactly one inventory: `proposeFollowers`
  // and the canvas's pickable list dedupe, and a DRAG on a dual-role shape means growth rather
  // than the picture toggle a plain click still means (MapSvgFieldsStep).
  //
  // WIDEST FIRST: the
  // background of a banner is the widest rectangle in it, and the picker should lead with the
  // shape the reader means nine times out of ten. A `<path>` whose data reads as a rectangle
  // (Illustrator's rounded rectangle) qualifies exactly like a `<rect>` — see panelPathGeometry;
  // a path inside an outlined-text suspect is a GLYPH (an outlined capital I is a bar) and is
  // never a panel.
