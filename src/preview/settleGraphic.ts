/**
 * Park a composed graphic at its SETTLED on-air state inside a preview iframe.
 *
 * A graphic is hidden until `play()` runs, so any surface that shows one WITHOUT a playback
 * gesture - a Home card's thumbnail, the operator panel's preview before the first take - must
 * drive it to rest itself, or it reads as an empty black frame. This is that one recipe, shared
 * so those surfaces can never drift into a second render path (the editor canvas settles the
 * same way in PlayoutSimulator).
 *
 * The recipe: write the data, jump the house entrance builder to the end of its FINITE
 * motion, write the data AGAIN, and jump again. The second `update()` is load-bearing - the
 * seek suppresses GSAP callbacks, so anything a callback writes (a counter's digits, a bar's
 * fill) would otherwise be left at its pre-entrance value while the layout around it sits at
 * the end state.
 *
 * THE SECOND JUMP IS LOAD-BEARING TOO, and for the opposite reason: a design whose `update()`
 * RE-RENDERS its own rows throws the settled frame away with the elements it was written on. The
 * credits family is the worked example (templates/endCredits/shared.ts `rebuildCredits` assigns
 * `track.innerHTML`), and both of its failure modes were on the Browse grid on 2026-08-26:
 *
 *   - the one-pager design came back with EVERY page at its CSS opacity, so all six sections
 *     drew on top of each other - the "mess" the owner reported;
 *   - the roll, the crawl and the repeating reel kept the travel transform on the surviving
 *     track while its content was replaced, parking a full list off-screen: a blank card.
 *
 * Re-deriving the jump over whatever `update()` just built fixes both, and costs nothing on a
 * design that does not rebuild: the builder is measured from the same DOM and writes the same
 * end values onto the same elements.
 *
 * A template with no builder (blank, hand-written, foreign import) has no entrance to jump, so
 * it gets its own `play()` and is allowed to come to rest on its own clock.
 *
 * ── WHY "THE END OF THE FINITE MOTION" AND NOT `progress(1)` ──
 *
 * An ENDLESS track has no end, and one endless child is enough to take the whole timeline's
 * end with it: GSAP reports the duration of a timeline containing a `repeat: -1` child as its
 * infinity sentinel, 1e10 seconds. `progress(1)` on that seeks to t = 1e10, which is not "the
 * end" of anything - it is an arbitrary phase of whatever is still looping there.
 *
 * That is not a hypothetical. EVERY end-credits design carries an ambient background drift
 * (`.credits-ambient`, `repeat: -1, yoyo`), so every one of them reports a duration of 1e10.
 * Measured over the thirteen of them on 2026-08-26, viewport coverage of the settled frame:
 *
 *                                    cr06   cr08   cr01
 *   one jump, progress(1)              0%     0%    69%
 *   one jump, the finite end          51%    69%    69%
 *   two jumps, the finite end        100%   100%    69%
 *
 * The two `credits-loop` reels settled to a COMPLETELY EMPTY frame - on every Home card,
 * every library thumbnail and every operator preview - and each of the two fixes above
 * repairs that on its own. **The second jump is the one that carries it**; the finite end is
 * the narrower correctness fix beside it, and on a roll (cr01, whose travel IS finite) it
 * changes nothing at all. It earns its place anyway, because seeking ten billion seconds in
 * and landing on a full frame is luck: it holds only because a reel clones enough copies to
 * cover the viewport at ANY phase. The next endless travel that does not will not be lucky.
 *
 * So: a settled graphic is parked at the end of the motion that HAS an end. An endless track
 * is left wherever the finite motion put it, because "the end" of a thing that never ends is
 * not a place.
 *
 * A ROLL still settles on its own designed rest pose (the logo and year centred), because a
 * roll's travel IS finite - it is the reel and the marquee that have no end. What a preview
 * must never do is show the empty frame a travelling graphic starts from; that is the same
 * fault seen from the other side, and it is why the wizard's preview settles a measured
 * graphic instead of playing it (components/wizard/WizardPreview.tsx).
