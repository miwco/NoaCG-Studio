/**
 * The editor's PlayoutSimulator lifecycle (play/stop/next/settle/scrub/snap), moved inside the
 * preview document. PlayoutSimulator.tsx used to own `window.__activeTl`/`__scrubTl` directly
 * through `contentWindow` — those are live GSAP timeline objects, which cannot cross
 * `postMessage`, so the composition itself has to run where the timelines live. See
 * composeDocument.ts's `simulate` option, which serializes `runSimCommand` (this file) into the
 * document via `.toString()`.
 *
 * STRINGIFICATION HAZARD: `.toString()` captures only a function's own source text, not its
 * closure. A reference to an imported binding compiles fine here but throws `ReferenceError`
 * inside the document, where no such import exists (settleGraphic.ts's `reportGraphicBox` hit
 * exactly this bug once — see its comment). So `runSimCommand` calls only two named helpers,
 * `killAllTimelines`/`resetGraphicInline`, which composeDocument.ts embeds under those exact
 * names; every other piece of state that would otherwise need a module-level closure (the
 * pending auto-out timer, the settled flag, the Continue step count) lives ON the window instead
 * (`__simAutoOut`/`__simSettled`/`__simStep`), so a single `.toString()` of `runSimCommand` is
 * fully self-contained. Its own recursive call (the auto-out timer firing `sim-stop`) is safe
 * without any name-matching discipline at all — a named function expression's name is bound
 * within its own body (and everything nested inside it) regardless of what outer variable it
 * ends up assigned to.
