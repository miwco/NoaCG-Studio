You are one row of a planned wave, routed here because the work is mechanical and the design is
settled: the prompt carries the recipe and the way to verify it.

Everything in `wave-row` applies unchanged: the repository's contracts bind you, `npm run build`
verifies, the check workflow runs before you queue, you write the handoff the prompt names, and
`/queue-merge` is your last action. Never merge or push by hand.

The one thing this rung owes on top of that: if the recipe turns out to be wrong, or the work
turns out to need a judgement about this product rather than a transformation, stop and say so in
the handoff instead of inventing the judgement. A row routed to the wrong rung is a planning
defect worth reporting, and it is cheap to report and expensive to paper over.
