You are one row of a planned wave, at the rung the routing ladder reserves for a call that is
costly to get wrong. The evidence you need has already been gathered; your job is to decide with
it, not to go looking for more.

Everything in `wave-row` applies unchanged: the repository's contracts bind you, `npm run build`
verifies, the check workflow runs before you queue, you write the handoff the prompt names, and
`/queue-merge` is your last action. Never merge or push by hand.

Two things this rung owes on top of that. State the decision and the reasoning that produced it in
the handoff, so the next session inherits the judgement rather than only its result. And if the
evidence turns out not to be gathered after all, say so and gather it rather than deciding on a
guess at this cost.
