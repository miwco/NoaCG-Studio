# Pack taxonomy — every reference format, mapped

Phase 3's taxonomy deliverable (docs/noacg-master-goals.md): the 60 live-program formats in
`live_format_graphics_needs.xlsx` (repo root, untracked) each map to exactly one **pack** — a
curated subset of graphic types in a fitting style family. The machine-readable half of this
document is **`src/templates/packs.ts`**; `scripts/factory.mjs` validates the two against the
live registry on every run, so this mapping cannot silently rot.

**A pack is pure config.** Because the type × family matrix is full (docs/GRAPHIC_TYPES.md §6),
every `(type, family)` cell already names a shipped, gate-checked design — so declaring a pack
is one entry in `PACKS`, no new template work. That is the "catalog growth is a config change"
half of Phase 3's done-when, made true for the axis it is true on:

- **A new pack = config.** Add the entry; the factory proves it resolves and that the format
  mapping stays exactly-once.
- **A new THEME ≠ config, deliberately.** A fifth family needs a `FAMILY_TOKENS` row, twelve
  designs (one per type, each through the six gates), and the wizard's family chip. The matrix
  fill measured that real cost at ~30 designed variants per two families; pretending a theme is
  a config knob would just move that work somewhere unreviewed. `validatePacks` fails a pack
  pointing at an unfilled family, which keeps the claim honest.
- **The pack's family is a default, not a constraint.** Any pack resolves in any of the four
  families — the family field is the curated taste pick a non-technical user starts from.

What a pack does NOT yet have is a wizard surface (a "start from a pack" entry). That is a
product decision about the creation flow, left open on purpose; the taxonomy and the config are
ready for it either way.

## The twelve packs

| Pack | Family | Types (curated order) | Extras |
|---|---|---|---|
| Match Day | sport | scoreboard, countdown, lower-third, ticker, sponsor-bug, title-card, holding-screen | vs01, cr03 |
| Esports | sport | scoreboard, lower-third, countdown, agenda, social-bug, sponsor-bug, holding-screen, title-card | vs02 |
| Creator | noacg | holding-screen, lower-third, topic-card, social-bug, sponsor-bug, countdown, poll | — |
| Newsroom | minimal | lower-third, ticker, topic-card, title-card, agenda, sponsor-bug | — |
| Election | minimal | poll, lower-third, ticker, title-card, agenda, countdown | — |
| Talk Show | glass | lower-third, topic-card, poll, agenda, social-bug, sponsor-bug, countdown | — |
| Corporate Events | minimal | agenda, lower-third, countdown, title-card, topic-card, poll, holding-screen | — |
| Classroom | noacg | quiz-board, countdown, lower-third, topic-card, agenda, scoreboard | — |
| Church & Ceremony | minimal | title-card, lower-third, topic-card, holding-screen, countdown, agenda | cr01 |
| Stage & Music | glass | title-card, lower-third, holding-screen, countdown, social-bug, agenda, ticker | cr02 |
| Shopping | noacg | topic-card, countdown, lower-third, ticker, title-card, sponsor-bug | — |
| Wellness | minimal | countdown, holding-screen, topic-card, lower-third, social-bug | — |

**Extras** are catalog variants outside the type registry that belong in the kit: the versus
card (vs01/vs02) for match-up reveals, end credits (cr01–cr03) where a program rolls them.
They ship without a state machine beyond the derived one, which is correct for what they are.

Family picks, briefly: sport carries both competitive packs; noacg (the house on-air look) goes
to the streamer-native packs where its amber control-room voice reads natively; glass suits the
premium conversational/stage registers; minimal serves every context where the graphics must
defer to the content (news, civic, corporate, worship, wellness). All taste — swappable per
project, and reviewable without touching the mapping below.

## What the sheet asks for that no type covers (the gap list)

Recorded so the next type is chosen by evidence, not vibes — the same way the first twelve
were. Roughly by how many formats ask.

### Closed

Eight of the gaps below now ship, as eight types and two new categories (25 designs). Each
kept the rule the first twelve were built on — *persist a machine only when the derived one is
wrong* — so only the transition declares one.

- **Goal / progress bar** → the **goal-meter** type (`ig22` House Goal, `ig23` Frost Goal).
  Two numbers and everything else derived: the share, the grouped figures, the caption. The
  bar and the ring are one type because they differ only in where the derived share is drawn.
  A second measured builder (`infographicGoalRing`) and its `goal-ring` preset exist because a
  goal ring's angle and its counted figure are DIFFERENT numbers — reusing the poll board's
  `ring-fill` would draw a full ring at 3 % raised. `ig05` Rising Total stays a hand-written
  variant: it predates the type and has no unit field.
- **Milestones / tiers** → the **milestone-track** type (`ig24`, `ig25`), the goal meter's
  sibling question ("which tiers have we passed"). Nodes are spaced EVENLY and the line is
  interpolated between them, never plotted at current/max — see `infographics/dataRuntimes.ts`.
- **Frames** → a new **`frame` category** (`fr01`–`fr04`: webcam, two-up interview, split
  screen, screen-share + presenter inset). Chrome around a HOLE rather than a box holding its
  own content, so the interiors stay transparent and every design states its window rectangles
  in design pixels in its own header. It is a category and **not** a type: a frame's field
  count follows its camera count (2, 3 or 4 lines), and `GraphicType` declares one field list —
  see "Known limitations" below.
- **Replay wipes / stingers** → a new **`transition` category** (`tr01`–`tr04`) and the
  **transition** type, the first graphic whose whole content is its LIFECYCLE. Its entrance
  COVERS the frame and holds there (that hold is the cut point); a `timer` arrow from the
  entrance waypoint straight to the exit clears it, with `next` as the manual version. Nothing
  in it uses `setTimeout` — a timer inside a template is motion the timeline cannot see, the
  control page cannot pause and the render clock cannot drive.
- **QR code** → the **qr-card** type (`card44`, `card45`). Honest field model, NOT generation:
  NoaCG bundles no encoder and generated templates take no runtime dependency, so the code is
  an SPX image field the operator points at their own PNG, and the address beside it is real
  text (which is also what makes the card work for a viewer who cannot scan). The white tile
  and its padding are a scannability requirement, not styling. A bundled encoder remains a real
  option and is recorded as open below.
- **CTAs** (follow / donate / register / buy) → the **call-to-action** type (`lt55`–`lt57`).
  The verb is a FIELD, which is what stops this being four near-identical designs.
- **Commerce cards** → the **product-card** (`card38`, `card39`), **offer-card** (`card40`,
  `card41`) and **listing-card** (`card42`, `card43`) types. The listing card is one graphic
  for the auction lot, the property walk-through and the stock counter, because the only thing
  that differs is the value's LABEL — so the label is a field.
- **Sponsor / logo strips** → `card48` House Sponsors and `card49` Clean Partners
  (hand-written; see below for why they are not a type). Neither ROTATES, deliberately: the
  ticker type is the one that cycles and it earns it with a real machine, a timer armed at the
  end of a finite entrance, and a pause/resume an operator can reach. A CSS keyframe loop
  swapping slot opacity would be none of those.
- **Location / travel cards** → `card46` Frost Location and `card47` Volt Location
  (hand-written). The pin is a DRAWN MARKER: there is no map surface, no tiles and no
  projection anywhere in the product, so nothing here plots a coordinate — the picture is an
  image field the operator chooses and the coordinates are text they type.

### Still open

- **Data charts / maps** (weather, election maps, finance charts, heatmaps) — a real data-viz
  surface, out of scope for the current model; revisit with external data feeds (master goals
  §1.5). The location cards above deliberately do NOT approach this.
- **Chat / alert overlays** (chat highlight, follower alerts) — show-chat territory
  (src/community/showchat) more than template territory; the bridge is a product decision.
- **Reveal moments** (winner reveal, nominee cards, before/after) — the quiz board's reveal
  machinery generalizes; a "reveal card" type is the natural next stateful type.
- **Lineups / brackets / leaderboards / stats panels** (sports & esports depth) — the agenda's
  rows and the scoreboard cover the basics; the full versions are their own types.
- **Lyrics / captions / surtitles** — timed-text playout is a different runtime problem; out
  of scope until external feeds exist.
- **A bundled QR encoder** — the qr-card type covers the FORMAT with an image field. Generating
  the code from a URL field would need an encoder inlined into every export (non-negotiable 3
  forbids a CDN call at playout), which is a real, self-contained piece of work and a real size
  cost. Worth doing when the field model proves the demand.

None of these block a pack: every format's CORE need is covered by the shipped types, which is
what the mapping above records.

## Known limitations this round surfaced

- **A graphic type declares ONE field list, so a family whose field COUNT varies cannot be one
  type.** Three families in this pack are affected and stay hand-written variants (which the
  catalog has always allowed — `card04`, `vs01`, `ig01`–`ig07` are all in that class):
  - **camera frames** — 2 fields for a single camera, 3 for a screen share, 4 for a two-up;
  - **sponsor strips** — `card48` carries 4 slots, `card49` carries 6;
  - **location cards** — `card46` has a picture slot, `card47` has no room for one.
  Fixing it properly means letting a type declare OPTIONAL fields (and teaching the factory's
  fields gate to compare against a range), which is a change to the type contract and belongs
  in its own round rather than being bent around here.
- **An individual camera window is not a registry part.** A split design carries several
  `.frame-window` elements under one class so a single preset drives one camera or four, and
  `model/structure.ts` requires single-match selectors for identity. The root, the stage and
  every text line ARE parts, which is what the timeline and canvas need; addressing one window
  of four would need numbered selectors the way the quiz's answer rows have them.
- **The runtime bench measures little of a self-clearing graphic.** Its layout checks run at
  the settled state, and a transition has cleared itself by then (the bench accelerates GSAP
  20×, and the timer with it), so a transition passes the entrance, exit, replay and binding
  checks but its covered pose is measured only by the catalog render baseline. The entrance
  check itself was moved to poll BEFORE the settle wait so it asks the question while the
  entrance is playing — otherwise every self-clearing graphic reads as "never appeared".

## Keeping this true

- `scripts/factory.mjs` (dev server up) validates on every run: pack ids unique, every type id
  known, every `(type, family)` cell filled, every extra in the catalog, and the format list
  covering exactly `REFERENCE_FORMAT_COUNT` (60) with no double-mapping.
- Editing the sheet means updating `packs.ts` formats and this document together; the count
  assertion catches a drift in either direction.
- The pack lineup itself (names, family picks, which formats cluster) is a taste layer over a
  mechanical core — review it like a design, change it like config.
