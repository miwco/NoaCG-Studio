# Pack taxonomy — every reference format, mapped

Phase 3's taxonomy deliverable (docs/noacg-master-goals.md): the 60 live-program formats in
`live_format_graphics_needs.xlsx` (repo root, untracked) each map to exactly one **pack** — a
curated subset of graphic types in a fitting style family. The machine-readable half of this
document is **`src/templates/packs.ts`**; `scripts/factory.mjs` validates the two against the
live registry on every run, so this mapping cannot silently rot.

**A pack is pure config.** Because the type × family matrix is full (docs/GRAPHIC_TYPES.md §6),
every `(type, family)` cell already names a shipped, gate-checked design — so declaring a pack
is one entry in `PACKS`, no new template work. That is the "catalog growth is a config change"
half of Phase 3's done-when, made true for the axis it is true on:

- **A new pack = config.** Add the entry; the factory proves it resolves and that the format
  mapping stays exactly-once.
- **A new THEME ≠ config, deliberately.** A fifth family needs a `FAMILY_TOKENS` row, twelve
  designs (one per type, each through the six gates), and the wizard's family chip. The matrix
  fill measured that real cost at ~30 designed variants per two families; pretending a theme is
  a config knob would just move that work somewhere unreviewed. `validatePacks` fails a pack
  pointing at an unfilled family, which keeps the claim honest.
- **The pack's family is a default, not a constraint.** Any pack resolves in any of the four
  families — the family field is the curated taste pick a non-technical user starts from.

What a pack does NOT yet have is a wizard surface (a "start from a pack" entry). That is a
product decision about the creation flow, left open on purpose; the taxonomy and the config are
ready for it either way.

## The twelve packs

## The nine DISCIPLINE packs (docs/SPORTS_PACK.md)

| Pack | Family | Shape it is cut for |
|---|---|---|
| Football | sport | count-up clock, subs and cards, the table, the weekend results |
| Ice Hockey | sport | period clock counting down, penalties, the period breakdown |
| Basketball | sport | quarter clock, the quarter-by-quarter board, team stats |
| Handball | glass | half clock, two-minute suspensions, the group table |
| Racket Sports | glass | set-by-set scoring (the stacked match board), the head-to-head |
| Motorsport | sport | the timing tower as a table, championship standings, session results |
| Athletics | glass | start lists, heat results, the medal table |
| Combat Sports | glass | round clock, the fight card, the tale of the tape, the decision |
| Club & School Sports | minimal | full club names, no crests needed, nothing that costs bitrate |

**A discipline pack declares NO reference formats, and that is the taxonomy point.** The sheet
counts FORMATS, and it has one row for "Sports broadcast / match coverage" and one for "Local
sports / amateur sports" — both owned by Match Day. A tennis kit is not a new format; it is the
same format cut for a sport that keeps score in sets and counts its clock the other way.
Claiming a format twice is an error `validatePacks` catches, and inventing rows the sheet does
not have would make its count meaningless. So the exactly-once mapping below is unchanged by
all nine.

This is also the first time the taxonomy has had two AXES: a pack can refine a format's kit
without owning the format. If more disciplines follow (cricket, rugby, cycling), they go here
the same way — config only, no new template work, because the type × family matrix is full.

**Extras** are catalog variants outside the type registry that belong in the kit: the versus
card (vs01/vs02) for match-up reveals — also the sports pack's upcoming-match hero — and end
credits (cr01–cr03) where a program rolls them. They ship without a state machine beyond the
derived one, which is correct for what they are.

Family picks, briefly: sport carries both competitive packs; noacg (the house on-air look) goes
to the streamer-native packs where its amber control-room voice reads natively; glass suits the
premium conversational/stage registers; minimal serves every context where the graphics must
defer to the content (news, civic, corporate, worship, wellness). All taste — swappable per
project, and reviewable without touching the mapping below.

## What the sheet asks for that no type covers (the gap list)

Recorded so the next type is chosen by evidence, not vibes — the same way the first twelve
were. Roughly by how many formats ask:

- **Goal / progress bar** (donation total, inventory, challenge progress) — the poll type's
  bars are close; a dedicated single-bar goal type would serve ~8 formats.
- **Data charts / maps** (weather, election maps, finance charts, heatmaps) — a real data-viz
  surface, out of scope for the current model; revisit with external data feeds (master goals
  §1.5).
- **Chat / alert overlays** (chat highlight, follower alerts) — show-chat territory
  (src/community/showchat) more than template territory; the bridge is a product decision.
- **Frames** (webcam frame, split-screen, reaction frame) — static surrounds, no data fields;
  arguably a new category rather than a type.
- **QR code** (7 formats: CTAs, donations, listings) — a small, high-value type candidate; an
  image field renders one today but a dedicated type could generate it from a URL field.
- **Reveal moments** (winner reveal, nominee cards, before/after) — the quiz board's reveal
  machinery generalizes; a "reveal card" type is the natural next stateful type.
- **Lineups / brackets / leaderboards / stats panels** (sports & esports depth) — the agenda's
  rows and the scoreboard cover the basics; the full versions are their own types.
- **Lyrics / captions / surtitles** — timed-text playout is a different runtime problem; out
  of scope until external feeds exist.
- **Replay wipes / stingers** — full-frame transition moments; the versus card's territory,
  worth a dedicated "stinger" type if demand shows.

None of these block a pack: every format's CORE need is covered by the shipped types, which is
what the mapping above records.

## Keeping this true

- `scripts/factory.mjs` (dev server up) validates on every run: pack ids unique, every type id
  known, every `(type, family)` cell filled, every extra in the catalog, and the format list
  covering exactly `REFERENCE_FORMAT_COUNT` (60) with no double-mapping.
- Editing the sheet means updating `packs.ts` formats and this document together; the count
  assertion catches a drift in either direction.
- The pack lineup itself (names, family picks, which formats cluster) is a taste layer over a
  mechanical core — review it like a design, change it like config.
