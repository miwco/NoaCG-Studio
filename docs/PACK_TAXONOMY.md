Phase 3's taxonomy deliverable (docs/noacg-master-goals.md): the 60 live-program formats in
`live_format_graphics_needs.xlsx` (repo root, untracked) each map to exactly one **pack** — a
curated subset of graphic types in a fitting style family. The machine-readable half of this
document is **`src/templates/packs.ts`**; `scripts/factory.mjs` validates the two against the
live registry on every run, so this mapping cannot silently rot.

**A pack is pure config.** Because the type × family matrix is full (docs/GRAPHIC_TYPES.md §6),
every `(type, family)` cell already names a shipped, gate-checked design — so declaring a pack
is one entry in `PACKS`, no new template work. That is the "catalog growth is a config change"
half of Phase 3's done-when, made true for the axis it is true on:

- **A new pack = config.** Add the entry; the factory proves it resolves and that the format
  mapping stays exactly-once.
- **A new THEME ≠ config, deliberately.** A fifth family needs a `FAMILY_TOKENS` row, one design
  per type (nineteen of them now, each through the six gates), and the wizard's family chip. The matrix
  fill measured that real cost at ~30 designed variants per two families; pretending a theme is
  a config knob would just move that work somewhere unreviewed. `validatePacks` fails a pack
  pointing at an unfilled family, which keeps the claim honest.
- **The pack's family is a default, not a constraint.** Any pack resolves in any of the four
  families — the family field is the curated taste pick a non-technical user starts from.

What a pack does NOT yet have is a wizard surface. Its SHAPE is now decided
(`TEMPLATE_TAXONOMY_PROPOSAL.md` §18, 2026-07-23): **a "start from a kit" ENTRY CARD, not a
third mode inside the Browse step** - Browse produces one graphic, a kit produces several, and
a surface that promises a single pick must not deliver something else. The taxonomy and the
config are ready for it; only the surface is unbuilt.

The title/topic/information pack's seven types, the identity family's eight and the competition
pack's twelve (docs/GRAPHIC_TYPES.md §6) all joined the kits that were standing in for them: the
newsroom gets a real headline card and a public notice instead of a topic card carrying a
paragraph, corporate and classroom get the process/checklist and the recap, church and stage get
the bilingual statement, now/next lands wherever a programme runs to a schedule, match day and
esports get real rosters, standings, brackets and winner cards, and every pack picks up the
persistent marks it actually leaves on screen. No format's mapping moved — the packs describe
the same 60 formats with graphics that fit them better. The audience pack's eight joined the same
way, and the holding / credits / ceremony set ships as EXTRAS rather than types (see below).

## The nine DISCIPLINE packs (docs/SPORTS_PACK.md)

| Pack | Family | Shape it is cut for |
|---|---|---|
| Football | sport | count-up clock, subs and cards, the table, the weekend results |
| Ice Hockey | sport | period clock counting down, penalties, the period breakdown |
| Basketball | sport | quarter clock, the quarter-by-quarter board, team stats |
| Handball | glass | half clock, two-minute suspensions, the group table |
| Racket Sports | glass | set-by-set scoring (the stacked match board), the head-to-head |
| Motorsport | sport | the timing tower as a table, championship standings, session results |
| Athletics | glass | start lists, heat results, the medal table |
| Combat Sports | glass | round clock, the fight card, the tale of the tape, the decision |
| Club & School Sports | minimal | full club names, no crests needed, nothing that costs bitrate |

**A discipline pack declares NO reference formats, and that is the taxonomy point.** The sheet
counts FORMATS, and it has one row for "Sports broadcast / match coverage" and one for "Local
sports / amateur sports" — both owned by Match Day. A tennis kit is not a new format; it is the
same format cut for a sport that keeps score in sets and counts its clock the other way.
Claiming a format twice is an error `validatePacks` catches, and inventing rows the sheet does
not have would make its count meaningless. So the exactly-once mapping below is unchanged by
all nine.

This is also the first time the taxonomy has had two AXES: a pack can refine a format's kit
without owning the format. If more disciplines follow (cricket, rugby, cycling), they go here
the same way — config only, no new template work, because the type × family matrix is full.

**Extras** are catalog variants outside the type registry that belong in the kit: the versus
card (vs01/vs02) for match-up reveals — also the sports pack's upcoming-match hero — and the
whole HOLDING / CREDITS / CEREMONY set: the
holding screens (ss05-ss13 - countdowns to a start time, breaks, technical pauses, sign-offs),
the list formats (cr05-cr12 - schedule boards, looping reels, thank-you and donor walls,
sponsor boards and crawls, ceremony rolls), and the set-piece cards (card50-card58 - readings,
lyrics, quotations, translations, orders of service, award, graduate, wedding and memorial).
They ship without a state machine beyond the derived one, which is correct for what they are.

The SPECIALIST lower thirds (ls01-ls32) join the same way, and they are the extras a kit is
most likely to be opened for: a strap drawn for ONE production rather than for any show. The
`lower-third` TYPE stays in every pack that had it - it is the general strap, and it is what a
non-technical user should still land on first - so these sit beside it as the graphic that
already knows the format's convention. The mapping is by production context, not by style
family: the athlete and commentary straps to Match Day, tag-and-handle identities to Esports,
the worship set to Church & Ceremony, the party-colour straps to Election, the billing straps
to Stage & Music, the speaker credits to Corporate Events and Classroom, and the newsroom's
analysis kicker, live flag, dateline and other-city clock to Newsroom. Two of them close a
stand-in the mapping below records: ls25 "Now Playing" is the graphic the radio-with-video row
had been borrowing a topic card for, and ls30 "World Clock" is what a market show cutting
between exchanges needs instead of a time somebody typed.

A strap can serve more than one pack (extras are not exclusive the way FORMATS are - `card52`
and `cr05` already were): ls24 "Expert Panel" is a newsroom explainer, a long-form panel credit
and a medical/legal webinar's credit, so it is in all three. **Shopping and Wellness get no
specialist strap, deliberately** - a selling host and a fitness instructor are named by an
ordinary lower third, and forcing one in would only make those kits harder to read.

The PUBLIC-SERVICE pack (docs/PUBLIC_SERVICE_PACK.md) joined next, and unlike the straps it
brought TWO TYPES as well as extras - the follow-up that document's §11 deliberately left open,
because adding a type changes what an existing pack ships:

- **`alert-level` -> Newsroom only.** The four-level severity ladder is what an emergency
  broadcast IS, and Newsroom owns "Emergency information stream", "Weather broadcast" and
  "Security / surveillance-style public stream". Its designs fill all four families, so any
  pack COULD take it; none of the others has a format that earns it.
- **`public-notice` -> Newsroom and Election.** The two-language rotator, in the two registers
  where carrying a notice in both languages is an obligation rather than a courtesy. Note the
  hard limit: `public-notice` ships only a minimal (pi09) and a noacg (pi08) design, so a
  glass or sport pack listing it would fail `validatePacks` on an empty matrix cell - which is
  the check doing exactly its job.

Three of the notes in the mapping below are now out of date in the right direction, and are
corrected there: the emergency stream's multilingual cards ARE a type now, the market show has
a real market ticker, and the council's bilingual notices have a graphic. Two kits that had no
extras from the straps round got real ones here - Shopping takes the disclaimer strip (price
and affiliate small print is a legal obligation on a selling stream) and Wellness takes it
alongside the health advisory, whose helpline sits in its own high-contrast band.

The four alerts with no machine (al07-al10) spread widest, because an unplanned fault is not a
format: the technical notice and the standby card go to the productions that run longest with
the fewest hands - Esports, Creator, Corporate - and the standby card also to Match Day (a rain
delay) and Stage (a delayed set), where it says something a planned intermission screen cannot.

Family picks, briefly: sport carries both competitive packs; noacg (the house on-air look) goes
to the streamer-native packs where its amber control-room voice reads natively; glass suits the
premium conversational/stage registers; minimal serves every context where the graphics must
defer to the content (news, civic, corporate, worship, wellness). All taste — swappable per
project, and reviewable without touching the mapping below.

## What the sheet asks for that no type covers (the gap list)

Recorded so the next type is chosen by evidence, not vibes — the same way the first twelve
were. Roughly by how many formats ask.

### Closed

Eight of the gaps below now ship, as eight types and two new categories (25 designs). Each
kept the rule the first twelve were built on — *persist a machine only when the derived one is
wrong* — so only the transition declares one.

- **Goal / progress bar** → the **goal-meter** type (`ig22` House Goal, `ig23` Frost Goal).
  Two numbers and everything else derived: the share, the grouped figures, the caption. The
  bar and the ring are one type because they differ only in where the derived share is drawn.
  A second measured builder (`infographicGoalRing`) and its `goal-ring` preset exist because a
  goal ring's angle and its counted figure are DIFFERENT numbers — reusing the poll board's
  `ring-fill` would draw a full ring at 3 % raised. `ig05` Rising Total stays a hand-written
  variant: it predates the type and has no unit field.
- **Milestones / tiers** → the **milestone-track** type (`ig24`, `ig25`), the goal meter's
  sibling question ("which tiers have we passed"). Nodes are spaced EVENLY and the line is
  interpolated between them, never plotted at current/max — see `infographics/dataRuntimes.ts`.
- **Frames** → a new **`frame` category** (`fr01`–`fr04`: webcam, two-up interview, split
  screen, screen-share + presenter inset). Chrome around a HOLE rather than a box holding its
  own content, so the interiors stay transparent and every design states its window rectangles
  in design pixels in its own header. It is a category and **not** a type: a frame's field
  count follows its camera count (2, 3 or 4 lines), and `GraphicType` declares one field list —
  see "Known limitations" below.
- **Replay wipes / stingers** → a new **`transition` category** (`tr01`–`tr04`) and the
  **transition** type, the first graphic whose whole content is its LIFECYCLE. Its entrance
  COVERS the frame and holds there (that hold is the cut point); a `timer` arrow from the
  entrance waypoint straight to the exit clears it, with `next` as the manual version. Nothing
  in it uses `setTimeout` — a timer inside a template is motion the timeline cannot see, the
  control page cannot pause and the render clock cannot drive.
- **QR code** → the **qr-card** type (`card44`, `card45`). Honest field model, NOT generation:
  NoaCG bundles no encoder and generated templates take no runtime dependency, so the code is
  an SPX image field the operator points at their own PNG, and the address beside it is real
  text (which is also what makes the card work for a viewer who cannot scan). The white tile
  and its padding are a scannability requirement, not styling. A bundled encoder remains a real
  option and is recorded as open below.
- **CTAs** (follow / donate / register / buy) → the **call-to-action** type (`lt55`–`lt57`).
  The verb is a FIELD, which is what stops this being four near-identical designs.
- **Commerce cards** → the **product-card** (`card38`, `card39`), **offer-card** (`card40`,
  `card41`) and **listing-card** (`card42`, `card43`) types. The listing card is one graphic
  for the auction lot, the property walk-through and the stock counter, because the only thing
  that differs is the value's LABEL — so the label is a field.
- **Sponsor / logo strips** → `card48` House Sponsors and `card49` Clean Partners
  (hand-written; see below for why they are not a type). Neither ROTATES, deliberately: the
  ticker type is the one that cycles and it earns it with a real machine, a timer armed at the
  end of a finite entrance, and a pause/resume an operator can reach. A CSS keyframe loop
  swapping slot opacity would be none of those.
- **Location / travel cards** → `card46` Frost Location and `card47` Volt Location
  (hand-written). The pin is a DRAWN MARKER: there is no map surface, no tiles and no
  projection anywhere in the product, so nothing here plots a coordinate — the picture is an
  image field the operator chooses and the coordinates are text they type.

### Still open

- **Data charts / maps** (weather, election maps, finance charts, heatmaps) — a real data-viz
  surface, out of scope for the current model; revisit with external data feeds (master goals
  §1.5). The location cards above deliberately do NOT approach this.
- **Chat / alert overlays** — ~~show-chat territory more than template territory~~ **SHIPPED**
  as the `chat-highlight` type (src/templates/audience). The product decision it was waiting on
  turned out to be a false choice: the graphic never needed a chat integration, because the
  operator types the comment, the handle and the SOURCE (plain text, never a platform logo) into
  ordinary fields. It self-dismisses on a real timer and can be held on air. Follower/donation
  ALERTS are still open — they are event-driven, which is the feed problem below.
- ~~**Reveal moments** (winner reveal, nominee cards, before/after)~~ — **CLOSED** by the
  competition pack (docs/COMPETITION_PACK.md): `nominee-reveal`, `winner-card`, `award-reveal`
  and `verdict-card` generalize the quiz board's reveal machinery, exactly as predicted here.
  Two more instances shipped with the audience pack — the `qa-card`'s answer and the
  `live-poll`'s winner call.
- **Audience questions and votes** — **SHIPPED** as the audience pack: `viewer-question`,
  `qa-card`, `chat-highlight`, `question-queue`, `community-request`, `live-poll`, and the two-
  and three-answer boards beside the existing four-answer one. They joined the `creator`,
  `election`, `talk-show`, `corporate`, `classroom` and `church` packs, which is pure config —
  the matrix was already full for them the moment their designs landed.
- ~~**Lineups / brackets / leaderboards / stats panels** (sports & esports depth)~~ — **CLOSED**
  by the same pack: `roster`, `standings` (leaderboards and result tables are the same board
  with different columns), `bracket`, `head-to-head` and `player-card`, plus `esports-score`
  and `map-round` for the series itself.
- **Lyrics / captions / surtitles** — timed-text playout is a different runtime problem; out
  of scope until external feeds exist.
- **A bundled QR encoder** — the qr-card type covers the FORMAT with an image field. Generating
  the code from a URL field would need an encoder inlined into every export (non-negotiable 3
  forbids a CDN call at playout), which is a real, self-contained piece of work and a real size
  cost. Worth doing when the field model proves the demand.

None of these block a pack: every format's CORE need is covered by the shipped types, which is
what the mapping above records.

## Known limitations this round surfaced

- **A graphic type declares ONE field list, so a family whose field COUNT varies cannot be one
  type.** Three families in this pack are affected and stay hand-written variants (which the
  catalog has always allowed — `card04`, `vs01`, `ig01`–`ig07` are all in that class):
  - **camera frames** — 2 fields for a single camera, 3 for a screen share, 4 for a two-up;
  - **sponsor strips** — `card48` carries 4 slots, `card49` carries 6;
  - **location cards** — `card46` has a picture slot, `card47` has no room for one.
  Fixing it properly means letting a type declare OPTIONAL fields (and teaching the factory's
  fields gate to compare against a range), which is a change to the type contract and belongs
  in its own round rather than being bent around here.
- **An individual camera window is not a registry part.** A split design carries several
  `.frame-window` elements under one class so a single preset drives one camera or four, and
  `model/structure.ts` requires single-match selectors for identity. The root, the stage and
  every text line ARE parts, which is what the timeline and canvas need; addressing one window
  of four would need numbered selectors the way the quiz's answer rows have them.
- **The runtime bench measures little of a self-clearing graphic.** Its layout checks run at
  the settled state, and a transition has cleared itself by then (the bench accelerates GSAP
  20×, and the timer with it), so a transition passes the entrance, exit, replay and binding
  checks but its covered pose is measured only by the catalog render baseline. The entrance
  check itself was moved to poll BEFORE the settle wait so it asks the question while the
  entrance is playing — otherwise every self-clearing graphic reads as "never appeared".

## Keeping this true

- `scripts/factory.mjs` (dev server up) validates on every run: pack ids unique, every type id
  known, every `(type, family)` cell filled, every extra in the catalog, and the format list
  covering exactly `REFERENCE_FORMAT_COUNT` (60) with no double-mapping.
- Editing the sheet means updating `packs.ts` formats and this document together; the count
  assertion catches a drift in either direction.
- The pack lineup itself (names, family picks, which formats cluster) is a taste layer over a
  mechanical core — review it like a design, change it like config.
