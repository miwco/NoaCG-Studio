# SMTP + Google OAuth provisioning - you committed to starting this week

Date: 2026-09-01, rewritten 2026-09-04 with the provider chosen and the DNS question answered.

## What this is

Ruling on the Teams plan's §8 question 5 (2026-09-01): the provisioning starts THIS WEEK, because
the class is this autumn and DNS verification is the step with lead time. Both jobs need consoles
we do not hold, which is why they are yours and not a session's.

## Do the SMTP half now, and leave Google until after the autumn class

There is an order forced by the product, not a preference. `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` records that email
confirmations are OFF and that Supabase auto-links identities by address. Together that means a
student who signs up with an address and a password, then later clicks "Continue with Google" on
the same address, **loses their password** - Supabase deletes the unconfirmed email identity when
it links. The account and the work survive; the password does not. Turning confirmations back on is
what removes that edge, and turning confirmations on needs working SMTP.

So SMTP is a prerequisite for fixing the Google problem, not an unrelated errand. And enabling
Google is the only thing that creates the problem, so it should wait. What SMTP buys immediately is
password reset, which today runs on Supabase's built-in sender - a testing facility capped at a
handful of messages an hour.

## The provider, and where the DNS goes

**Resend**, chosen 2026-09-04. `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` had listed five candidates and never picked
one. The free tier is 3,000 messages a month, far past a class, and setup is three DNS records
rather than a wizard. Nothing in the repo depends on the choice - Supabase authenticates to
whatever SMTP host it is given - so this is reversible.

**Vercel does not send email**, which is worth stating because it hosts the frontend. But it IS
the DNS host: `noacg.studio` answers on `ns1.vercel-dns.com` / `ns2.vercel-dns.com` (checked
2026-09-04), so Resend's records go in the Vercel dashboard under Domains, not at a registrar.
The domain carries no TXT records today, so there is no existing SPF to merge with.

**Gmail SMTP is not an option here.** It sends as `@gmail.com`, so Supabase's sender address
cannot match the domain; it throttles well below a class signing up at once; and Google suspends
accounts that send transactional mail in bursts.

## The route

1. Create a Resend account, add `noacg.studio` as a sending domain, and copy the records it
   shows into Vercel → the project → Domains → `noacg.studio`. Verification is usually under an
   hour.
2. Create a Resend API key. That key is the SMTP password.
3. Supabase dashboard → Authentication → Emails → SMTP Settings:
   - Sender email address: `noreply@noacg.studio`
   - Sender name: `NoaCG Studio`
   - Host: `smtp.resend.com`
   - Port: `465`
   - Username: `resend` - the literal word, not an email address. This is the field people get
     wrong, and a Gmail address in it is the sign that a Gmail setup was attempted.
   - Password: the `re_...` API key
4. Supabase → Authentication → Rate Limits. Attaching custom SMTP defaults to **30 new users per
   hour**, which is exactly one class arriving at once. Raise it.
5. Resend → turn OFF link tracking. It rewrites Supabase's single-use reset links and breaks them.

Google OAuth stays unstarted, and `GOOGLE_SIGN_IN_ENABLED` stays `false`. Its steps are in
`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`, "Google sign-in"; it is about twenty minutes of console work with no lead
time, so there is no reason to do it before the confirmations decision.

## What to look at

Done when a password reset delivers from `noreply@noacg.studio` and lands in an inbox rather than
spam. Send one to yourself after step 4.

## The decision still open

Whether to turn email confirmations back ON once SMTP works. It closes the password-deletion trap
and the address-squatting hole, and it costs every student one extra click before they can start.
Confirmations were turned off deliberately for the student push, so this is a real reversal rather
than a fix, and it is not settled.

## SMTP is LIVE - owner, 2026-09-04

Resend is set up, the domain verified, and the owner confirmed the first real password-reset mail
arrived. The DNS lead time this item existed to protect is behind us. Checked from the public DNS
rather than the dashboard: DKIM at `resend._domainkey.noacg.studio`, SPF
`v=spf1 include:amazonses.com ~all` and MX `feedback-smtp.eu-west-1.amazonses.com` on
`send.noacg.studio`, the region matching the Ireland choice.

**Two settings still outstanding, both in the Supabase dashboard:**

1. ~~Redirect URLs~~ **DONE 2026-09-04.** `https://noacg.studio/**` is in the allow-list and
   the reset link now returns to `/app` with a working session instead of the landing page. The
   recovery DIALOG still does not open, which is our bug rather than a setting, and the owner
   ruled it not urgent since a signed-in user can change the password from settings. Narrowed to
   a probable subscribe-after-emit race in `docs/backlog/password-reset-link-lands-nowhere.md`.
   Two entries in that allow-list, `noacg-studio.vercel.app/app` and `html-gfx-builder.vercel.app`,
   are unreachable - both 308 to `noacg.studio`, so the app never runs on them - and the Site URL
   still read `https://noacg-studio.vercel.app`, which is also the domain the email templates
   build their links from.
2. **Authentication → Rate Limits** - confirm it is above the 30 new users per hour that attaching
   custom SMTP sets by default. One class arriving at once is exactly 30.

**Still not started, deliberately:** DMARC (`_dmarc.noacg.studio` TXT `v=DMARC1; p=none;`), and
Google OAuth, which waits on the confirmations decision below.

## Auth URL configuration finished, 2026-09-04

Read from the owner's dashboard at the end of the session:

- **Site URL: `https://noacg.studio`.** It had been `https://noacg-studio.vercel.app`, which is
  also the domain the email templates build their links from - so reset mail was going out from
  `noreply@noacg.studio` carrying `.vercel.app` links, a mismatch spam filters score against you.
- **Redirect URLs: one entry, `https://noacg.studio/**`.** The two `.vercel.app` entries are gone.
  Both 308-redirect to the apex, so the app never ran on them and neither could ever have been
  used as a `redirectTo`; they were pre-rename cruft in a security-relevant allow-list.

Verified from public DNS the same day: DKIM and the `send.` MX still resolve.

**What is left on this item, smallest first:**

1. ~~DMARC~~ **DONE 2026-09-04.** `_dmarc.noacg.studio` publishes `v=DMARC1; p=none;`,
   confirmed resolving on both Google and Cloudflare resolvers minutes after it was added. All
   four records mail authentication needs are now live and verified from outside the account:
   DKIM, SPF, the bounce MX, and DMARC.
2. ~~Rate limits~~ **DONE 2026-09-04.** Raised to 60 new users per hour, double the 30 that
   attaching custom SMTP sets by default, so a class of 30 arriving at once has headroom.
3. **Google OAuth - deliberately unstarted.** Owner, 2026-09-04: *"let's do the Google auth later.
   That can remain on the to-do list, but there is no hurry for that."* It waits on the
   confirmations decision below, and enabling it before that decision is what silently deletes a
   student's password.

**The SMTP half of this item is FINISHED.** Everything above is done and verified from outside the
account. What keeps the item open is Google OAuth and the confirmations question, not mail.

## Both remaining halves deferred - owner, 2026-09-05

> Number two, I will not turn them back on yet and Google is not activated yet.

Verbatim, on the two questions this item still held. Neither is a "not decided" - both are
decisions, and they point the same way for the same reason: the class is this autumn, and every
click between a student and their first graphic is a click that costs more than the trap it
closes.

- **Email confirmations stay OFF.** The password-deletion edge stays open, and it only ever fires
  through Google sign-in, which is the next line.
- **Google OAuth stays unstarted**, `GOOGLE_SIGN_IN_ENABLED` stays `false`. That is what keeps the
  edge theoretical: with no Google button there is no identity to auto-link, so no student can
  lose a password to it. The two deferrals are consistent, not two separate risks.

Nothing here has lead time - Google is about twenty minutes of console work whenever he wants it -
so this item now waits on nothing and blocks nothing. The mail half is finished and verified from
outside the account (DKIM, SPF, bounce MX, DMARC, Site URL, redirect allow-list, rate limits).
