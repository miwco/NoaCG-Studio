# A score tracker on your own artwork, for as many teams as you drew

**The other half of 2026-09-12.** You confirmed the quiz end to end on your own board on
2026-09-03. This is the scoreboard half, built to what you asked for that evening: *"a simple
score tracker with two or more teams, with quick ways to add scores from a custom SVG file"*.

## The route, in under a minute

1. `/app` -> **New graphic** -> **Import graphic** -> drop
   `e2e/fixtures/svg-corpus/illustrator-four-team-scoreboard.svg`.
2. The mapping step's **What it does** section should already say *"a score tracker: a point, a
   flash, full time"*, with **four** teams and every picker filled in - the name, the figure and
   the flash for each row, plus Full time. Nothing to click.
3. **Next, Next**, name it, add it to a new production, **Take**.
4. Press **+1** under the first team. Press it again. Press **+1** under the third.
5. Press **−1** under the third.
6. Press **Full time**, then **New game**.

## What to look at

- **The +1 press does two things at once.** The figure on air moves AND the green bar you drew for
  that team comes up. They ride the same press, so they cannot disagree - which was your own point
  on 2026-08-23, that there is no reason to play the goal animation if the number does not change.
- **The flash follows the team.** Nothing in the graphic has a state per team; the row that
  flashed is the row whose number went up.
- **The −1 takes the point AND the flash back.** A mis-press should leave nothing of itself
  behind.
- **New game is one press** and it reaches the cue as well as the screen - look at the score boxes
  in the editor, not only at the graphic. That is the part that needed a new control road: a reset
  written the easy way would have zeroed the picture and left your boxes reading 2, so the next
  Update would have put the old score straight back on air.
- **The buttons are grouped by team**, using the layer name you gave that team, and each is
  labelled just `+1` / `−1`. That is what every scoreboard console does, and the survey behind it
  is `docs/SCORE_CONTROL_SURVEY.md`.

## The two things I want your eye on

1. **Is one point per press enough?** Every product surveyed offers a ROW of amounts instead
   (+1/+2/+3 for basketball, and SPX's own scoreboard ships -1/+1/+2/+5) - but every one of them
   makes the set author-configurable, because the right amounts are the sport's own rules. Adding
   a picker for that is the customization surface you ruled out on 2026-08-22, so it ships as one.
   If a class needs +2, that is the day to reopen it.
2. **`−1` at zero shows `-1`.** Nothing surveyed documents a clamp either way, and clamping would
   mean the graphic quietly disagreeing with the box the operator is typing in. It self-corrects
   with one press of `+1`. Say if you would rather it stopped at zero.

## Also worth a glance while you are in there

The cue editor now bands its fields by **row number** as well as by A/B, so a four-team board
reads as four small groups instead of one long row - your 2026-08-21 ask, applied to a board that
has more than two sides. That also picks up two catalog graphics that were flowing flat and are
the same shape: the **podium score** (four players) and the **bilingual public notice** (two
languages). Both are worth thirty seconds each.

**Not done, and deliberately:** the flash has no automatic timer, so **Clear flash** is a press.
The catalog scoreboard works the same way, and an arrow nobody drew closing a moment under the
operator is the hazard the vote board had to remove.
