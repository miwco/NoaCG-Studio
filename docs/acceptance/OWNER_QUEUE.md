# Owner queue - what is built and not yet confirmed by a human

The one thing about shipped work that no file in the repo can know: whether the owner has actually
LOOKED at it. Git knows what landed; only a person knows whether it was any good.

**The items are not in this file.** Each one is its own file in [`owner-queue/`](owner-queue/),
named `<date>-<slug>.md`. This file holds the rules they follow and the log of what was dropped.

Run **`/walk`** to go through them in one pass. It reads that directory, takes the owner to each
thing, and records the tick or the feedback. No open `walk` item IS the confirmation that nothing
is waiting.

## Why one file per item

Every session that lands observable work adds an item, and several sessions land in one night. A
shared list means N sessions appending at the same offset, which is a git conflict - and
`auto-merge.mjs` aborts on a conflict and stops, so the branch sits unlanded until a person looks
at it. One file per session cannot collide, so the queue costs a night wave nothing.

## The shape of an item

```markdown
---
kind: walk          # walk | walk-p | owner-action | hardware | agent
date: 2026-08-25    # when it was filed, so /walk can present newest first
needs: account      # owner-action ONLY, and REQUIRED there: account | money | identity | harness
serves: now         # OPTIONAL - set it when the work serves docs/GOALS.md ## NOW
---
# Short title

What changed, in one sentence a non-technical reader follows. Route: the URL, the branch or the
exact command - under a minute to reach, or it will not get walked. What to look at: the thing
that might be wrong, not a feature summary. The commit or branch it came from.
```

- `kind: walk` - the owner, at the computer. Five minutes at the desk with the product open.
- `kind: walk-p` - the owner, from his phone. A taste ruling, a preference, a direction call:
  anything he can answer in a sentence without the dev environment in front of him.
- `kind: owner-action` - only he can do it, and `needs:` says which of the four reasons it is.
  A technical problem is never one of them: see "A TECHNICAL problem is never his" below.
- `kind: hardware` - needs a CasparCG box, an SPX server or real people, and is not "unseen".
- `kind: agent` - an agent settles it by driving the product. Not for him at all.
- `done: true` - kept as a record rather than deleted, for an action whose outcome matters later.
- `answered: true` - optional. Set it when the item captures his feedback AND a later section
  answers it, so the re-look he is owed sorts ahead of items nobody has moved.
- `needs:` - REQUIRED on `owner-action`, meaningless anywhere else. One of `account`, `money`,
  `identity`, `harness`, defined in "A TECHNICAL problem is never his". Gated by
  `npm run check:owner-queue` for items dated 2026-09-05 or later.
- `serves: now` - optional, and the only thing that decides priority. Set it when the item's work
  serves the `## NOW` push in [`../GOALS.md`](../GOALS.md); leave it off otherwise. It lives in the
  item's own front matter rather than in a ranked list here, for the same reason the items do: five
  sessions editing one ordered list at the same offset is a git conflict, and a conflict strands a
  landing. When the push changes, the items that no longer serve it lose the key.

## Which kind does an item get

**Ask who can settle it, not how important it is.** If the item's remaining question is a claim
about the product - does this button do what the item says, does this file arrive with the right
answer, does the number reach the frame - an agent can drive it and confirm it, so the kind is
`agent` and the owner never sees it. If settling it needs a human opinion (taste, a preference,
a direction call) and that opinion fits in a sentence, it is `walk-p`, because the phone is the
cheapest place he can clear it from. If the opinion needs him looking at the screen or driving the
thing himself, it is `walk`. If it costs money, publishes past `main`, or needs an account we do
not hold, it is `owner-action`. If it needs a playout box, a server or an audience, it is
`hardware`. Be honest in both directions: *"does this look good"* is his, and *"does this button
do what the item claims"* is ours. An item that carries both halves is filed for the human half
and the agent half is checked before it is presented, so his minute is spent on the opinion.

### A design default is NOT a taste question (owner, 2026-09-03)

He pushed back on the whole shape of this queue after three walks that were, in his words, *"about
design, the look, and these kinds of issues"*:

> They were sent to me because you think I'm the only one that can answer these, but I want to push
> back on that. You are the almighty AI with all the design books and all the knowledge. This is
> not something that I should just choose how it looks like. There is logic to how this should be
> built, and we need to use that logic. We are not building stuff just the way I want it; it's
> about how people in general want it and what they think is the default.

> So, this mindset we need to teach the orchestrator in the future so it doesn't land this on my
> table when it can fix and figure out these things themselves.

**So "a human opinion is needed" is a much narrower test than it has been read as.** Before filing
anything as `walk-p` or `walk`, ask whether the question has a defensible general answer - what
broadcast graphics conventionally do, what a designer would expect, what most users would call
correct. If it does, **decide it, do it, and say in the item what you decided and why**, so he can
overrule a thing that exists rather than adjudicate a thing that does not. A default is research,
not taste.

What genuinely reaches him: money, direction, product scope, a call between two options that are
both defensible and point the product different ways, and whether a shipped thing is any good. Not
*"which of these should be the default"* when one of them is obviously conventional.

The failure this replaces is real and it was ours: he was asked to rule on the palette collapse,
on the growth default and on the ladder's per-field behaviour, and every one of those had a
defensible answer from ordinary design practice that nobody bothered to derive.

**Only a `kind: agent` item may be deleted on an agent's own verification**, and the commit that
deletes it says what was checked and what was seen. An agent confirming a claim is not the owner
having looked at it, and this queue exists to hold exactly that difference - a deleted item and a
walked one must not read identically afterwards.

### A TECHNICAL problem is never his (owner, 2026-09-04)

The section above narrowed which DESIGN questions reach him. This one closes the other door, and
he was blunt that he has said it before and it kept happening:

> if and when you want to ask the owner a question about how to fix it, just ask another agent or
> yourself the same question. You will be able to answer it.

> This is something fundamentally wrong with how we work, because I cannot solve merging issues
> or, if there are some CI problems and something is stuck behind something else, I cannot fix it.
> It is still going to be you who fixes it, so you do not need to have me for anything.

> when the orchestrator thinks that the owner (me) should do something and starts waiting for me,
> then it is a problem because I have no special skills to fix these issues.

> If it is a bug issue, if the code is wrong, if GitHub has problems, if the branches cannot land,
> if there is a problem with the worktrees, I do not know how to fix that. You know how to fix
> that, so you have to just prompt yourself with a question and ask, "What would you do in this
> situation?" You will find a way.

> I will just go and ask Claude myself, and it will give me the answer, and then I will paste it
> to you. It is totally pointless to have me here in the loop.

> this apparently needs to be a hard rule because I have been trying to tell you this many times,
> but still, I get these requests that I need to run a Bash command to merge a branch... I should
> not need to do that... You are much better at this than me.

**The hard rule. A technical problem is never an owner action.** A failing build, a red `main`, a
branch that will not land, a stuck queue, a worktree in a bad state, a GitHub Actions problem, a
broken hook, a dependency to upgrade, a command that needs running: every one of those is ours,
including the ones we have not solved yet. Not knowing how is not a reason to file it for him. It
is the reason to ask another agent, or to ask yourself the question you were about to ask him, and
then research it and do it. He has no skill here that we lack, and he has said so repeatedly. The
loop through him is him asking an AI and pasting the answer back to us.

**So `owner-action` needs a REASON, and the reason is a closed set.** Every item filed as
`owner-action` from 2026-09-05 carries a `needs:` key naming which one it is, and
`npm run check:owner-queue` refuses the item if it does not. There are four values and there is no
"other":

- **`account`** - credentials or a console we do not hold: his GitHub notification settings, a
  Google Cloud project, a registry login.
- **`money`** - it costs money, or it publishes past `main` where a later commit cannot take it
  back.
- **`identity`** - he has to speak or sign as himself or as the organisation: an email to the EBU,
  his name on a pull request, a licence clarification from a vendor.
- **`harness`** - the agent harness refuses it by design, and the item says which refusal it hit.
  This is the narrow one and it is the easiest to abuse: it means the tooling stopped an agent, not
  that the agent found the job hard. Two real cases, both hit on 2026-09-04 while writing this
  rule: a session cannot add entries to its own `.claude/settings.json` permission allowlist, and a
  session cannot run a global install that mutates the machine outside the repo. Both refusals are
  deliberate, and a session that can widen its own permissions has none.

**If none of the four fits, it is not his, and the item does not get filed. The work gets done.**
An existing `owner-action` item that cannot name one is MIS-KINDED: re-kind it, or just do it.
That is the one exception to "`owner-action` and `hardware` are never re-kinded" in the next
section, and it runs in the safe direction only, off his list and never onto it.

**And never WAIT on him.** An item on this list is a to-do, not a dependency, and the rest of the
work carries on around it. If a landing, a wave or a session has stopped, and the only reason it
has stopped is that somebody filed an item for him, that is the bug.

### Re-kinding an item, including one filed for him

The filing session picks the kind (`.agent-workflows/walk.md` §4), and that is what makes routing
automatic rather than a triage job. But a kind can be WRONG - filed before the design-default rule
above existed, or filed as `agent` and then found to be unsettleable by one. So re-kinding is
allowed, in both directions, under three conditions, and they exist because the obvious abuse is
real: **a session that may convert `walk` to `agent` and then delete it on its own verification can
empty this queue without anybody looking at anything.**

1. **The re-kind says which half of the test it met**, in the item, above its original text. For
   `walk`/`walk-p` to `agent`: the remaining question is a claim about the product an agent drives,
   or a default with a defensible general answer. For `agent` back to `walk`: what an agent tried
   and why it could not finish.
2. **Re-kinding to `agent` and DELETING that item are separate commits.** The re-kind commit stands
   on its own with its reasoning, so the conversion is reviewable independently of the walk that
   followed it. A single commit that both converts and deletes is the shape this rule refuses.
3. **`owner-action` and `hardware` are never re-kinded.** They need his account, his money or his
   hardware, and no argument about the question's nature changes that.

**A `walk` item whose remaining question is genuinely his is not re-kinded because an agent could
look at the screen.** The test is who can SETTLE it, not who can observe it: *"is this any good"*
and *"is this the product you asked for"* stay his however drivable the route is.

**And an `agent` item no agent can finish is worse than a `walk` item**, because it sits on a list
he is never shown. If a walk attempt fails for an environmental reason rather than a product one,
re-kind it back and say so - that happened on 2026-09-04, when a night session found it could not
judge a 1.34 s entrance in a hidden browser pane throttled to about a frame a second.

## The order the owner sees them in

**The kind decides which list an item is in; three keys decide the order inside it, and none of
them is a judgement made at presentation time** - so two sessions running `/walk` an hour apart
show him the same order.

`/walk` presents `walk-p` before `walk`, because a phone item costs him a sentence and a desk item
costs him five minutes at the machine. Inside each of those two lists the order is **`serves: now`
first, then `answered: true`, then newest `date:`** - all three front-matter keys, defined once in
the shape section above, so nothing here re-derives anything.

**`owner-action` is presented too, as its own short list after the other two**, because every one
of them is a real ask nobody else can do and there have never been more than a handful. Within it,
an item naming a real-world date leads (the OGraf ecosystem listing is against IBC on 12
September). Only **`hardware`** stays a count unless he asks, since it needs a playout box or an
audience rather than a decision. `done: true` is never presented.

**`kind: agent` is presented to the AGENT, never to him.** `/walk` reports how many are open in one
clause and offers to walk them; `/walk agent` walks that list. An agent item nobody ever reads is
worse than no item, because it looks handled - so if the count is not zero, it is a row of work,
not a note.

## How this list stays honest

- **An item goes in when the work lands**, with what to look at and how to reach it in under a
  minute. No item without a route.
- **An item leaves when it is walked** - `/walk` deletes the file. Git holds the history, so
  nothing is lost by removing it.
- **Feedback keeps the item open**, captured verbatim in the file, until the feedback is addressed.
- **Nothing is dropped for being old.** An item waits until the owner walks it, however long that
  takes.

Nothing here is a gate. It is a to-do list.

## Why age no longer drops an item

Until 2026-08-30 a `kind: walk` item older than 7 days was deleted as presumed seen, on the
reasoning that the owner tests most things within a couple of days. **Owner ruling, 2026-08-30:
nothing expires - he will get to all of them** (39 open at the time).

The expiry was solving queue LENGTH by discarding the one thing this queue exists to hold: a
deleted item and a walked item look identical afterwards, so the mechanism quietly biased the
record towards "all confirmed". Length belongs to the owner to pace. He ruled the same day that a
deep queue must not hold other work back either (*"nothing should block stuff"*), so **the queue
neither blocks nor evaporates - it is a list, not a dependency, and it may grow.** Anyone
re-enabling an expiry is turning that trade back on and should have an answer better than
"presumed".

## Dropped

The log of items removed without being walked, kept so a wrong drop is visible rather than silent.
The 7-day expiry that wrote the entry below no longer exists, so nothing is added here except by
an explicit decision to drop something.

**A `kind: agent` item deleted after an agent drove its route is not a drop and does not belong
here.** It was walked - by an agent rather than by him - and the evidence is the commit message,
which the rules above require to say what was checked and what was seen. The distinction matters
in both directions: putting those in this log would bury the real drops, and leaving a genuine
drop out of it is the silence this log exists to break.

- 2026-08-20-ig39-key-figures - dropped 2026-08-28, presumed seen
- 2026-08-30-b-antigravity-write-rule - dropped 2026-08-30, ALREADY DONE. It asked the owner to
  rewrite two `write_file` rules in his Antigravity settings so headless writes would stop being
  denied; he made that change the same afternoon and it was verified working (a write inside the
  granted directory succeeds, one above it is denied). Recorded in `docs/HARNESS_ROUTING.md`. Not a
  presumption - the thing it asked for was checked and found done.

## The standing instruction behind all of it (owner, 2026-09-03, closing the walk)

The rule above says which questions reach him. This says why, in his words, and it is the more
important half:

> One of the most important things from this whole session is that the agent, the orchestrator,
> has to trust itself more. You do know what to do. Search the internet, use logic; all these
> questions that you ask me right now can be answered by an all-knowing AI LLM.

> The goal is not rocket science. The agents need to have more agency and research a problem
> before asking me.

> But I just wish that I don't get questions that I myself would ask an AI to answer, if you know
> what I mean. There are very few questions that you do not know the answer to, trust me.

**The test, and it is the sharpest form of it we have: would he have to ask an AI to answer this?
Then it is not a question for him.** Research it - the web included - decide it, do it, and write
down what you decided and why. He overrules things that exist; he should not be asked to
adjudicate things that do not.

He was explicit that this is not a request to stop talking to him: *"It's easy for me to answer
questions because I can do that on the phone, so questions are fine"*, and *"there are many things
I want to double-check for real, and it's good that they are added to the walk"*. The cost he is
protecting is not his attention, it is his TIME AT A MACHINE - a sentence costs him nothing, and
clicking through menus and drawing SVGs costs him a lot.

And the standard the work is measured against, which is why the agency matters:

> whatever they are doing, we need to catch up. We need to have a graphic creator that can play out
> graphics that I can use with my students and, one day, with the rest of the world.

MXMZ and singular.live ship these capabilities today. A question parked on his desk overnight is a
day we do not catch up.
