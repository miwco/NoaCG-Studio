# Agent save: scoped keys, the consent handoff, the save door, the boundary gates

The second phase of the agent door (`docs/AGENT_CLI.md`): how a coding agent's CLI puts a
graphic into a user's NoaCG library without ever holding the user's session, and what changed
at the library->air boundary so that a record the server never executed can still be trusted
on air.

```

## 1. The credential: a scoped agent key

- **Shape.** `noacg_ak_` + 64 hex. Stored only as `sha256` in `agent_keys.key_hash` (migration
  `0050`); the plaintext is returned exactly once by `redeem` and lives on the CLI's disk.
- **Scope.** A key carries a list of permissions (`src/entitlements/permissions.ts`). In this
  release every key carries exactly `graphics:create` - it can put a graphic in the library
  and nothing else: not read the library, not touch a production, not use AI, not delete.
  `playout:operate` is named now and is NEVER granted to an agent key (`NEVER_ON_AGENT_KEYS`).
- **`permits(principal, key)`** asks two questions, both required: the credential carries the
  permission (a session carries all, a key its list), AND the account's entitlement allows the
  feature the permission rides on (`graphics:create` -> `sync.cloud`). So a suspended account's
  key is dead, and the instance-wide `sync.cloud` switch stops agent saves (`docs/ADMIN.md`
  enforcement table). A permission can only ever NARROW what the account may do.
- **Principal resolution** is one door, `api/_lib/principal.ts resolvePrincipal(req)`: a
  Supabase JWT -> a session (`granted: null`); `Bearer noacg_ak_…` -> hash lookup through the
  0050 `agent_key_resolve` RPC -> the key's scopes (+ `last_used_at` stamped in the same
  statement); anything else -> anonymous. Every lookup failure degrades to anonymous - fail
  closed. A future OAuth access token is one more branch here, same `permits` downstream.
- **Storage on the CLI side** (`cli/src/auth.ts`): `<config dir>/credentials.json`, keyed by
  deployment origin (`%APPDATA%\noacg`, `~/Library/Application Support/noacg`,
  `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/noacg`); 0700/0600 on POSIX, the directory's ACL reset to the current user on
  Windows (best effort). `NOACG_AGENT_KEY` (CI) beats the file; `noacg login --key` stores a
  pasted key. A keychain is a native dependency and is deliberately not in v1.

## 2. The handoff: how a key is minted without transiting the browser

1. `noacg login` invents a PKCE `verifier`, listens on `127.0.0.1:<random port>`, and opens
   `${NOACG_URL}/app?agent=<state>&port=<port>&name=<"noacg CLI on HOST">&challenge=<sha256 hex of verifier>`.
2. The consent page (`src/components/auth/AgentAccessConsent.tsx`, a query route in `App.tsx`
   beside `?control=` and `?chat=`) parses the request (`src/backend/agentAccess.ts
   parseAgentRequest`: state 8-128 url-safe chars, port 1024-65535, challenge 64 hex; anything
   else is refused before it asks). Signed in, it asks ONE question - *Allow "<name>" to save to
   your library?* - listing exactly what the key may do and naming the loopback port the code
   will go to. Signed out, it shows the sign-in prompt with the create-account half leading. An
   OFFLINE build (no backend) shows an honest "no account backend" card and ZERO auth UI
   (`e2e/agent-access.spec.ts`; the auth posture of root `AGENTS.md`).
3. Allow -> `POST /api/me/agent-keys {action:'begin', name, challenge}` with the user's JWT ->
   the server writes `agent_auth_codes` (hash of a fresh 256-bit code, the challenge, 120 s
   expiry) and returns the plaintext code. The page redirects ONLY to
   `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/callback#code=…&state=…` (`agentCallbackUrl` - the host is never read
   from the URL, the code rides the FRAGMENT so no server request line ever carries it).
4. The listener's page forwards the fragment to the CLI (`POST /complete` on the loopback),
   which checks `state` and calls `POST /api/me/agent-keys {action:'redeem', code, verifier}`
   (no auth). The server CONSUMES the code atomically (`agent_code_consume`: one `UPDATE …
   RETURNING`, so a racing second redeem finds nothing), checks `sha256(verifier) === challenge`,
   mints the key with the scopes the code was minted with, and returns the plaintext once. A
   wrong verifier still burns the code - an intercepted code must not stay redeemable.
5. The CLI stores the key. `noacg whoami` asks the deployment to describe it (prefix, name,
   scopes, last used); `noacg logout` revokes it (a key may revoke ITSELF and nothing else) and
   forgets it; Settings → Account → **Agent access** lists every live key with a Revoke button.
   Revocation takes effect on the key's next request.

## 3. The save door: `POST /api/me/graphics`

In order - the order IS the posture (`api/_lib/me/graphics.ts`):

1. `resolvePrincipal` (a session JWT or an agent key);
2. `permits(principal, 'graphics:create')` - a revoked key, a suspended account and the
   instance-wide switch all stop here;
3. rate limits, per IP and per PRINCIPAL (the account), before a byte of body is read;
4. `readJson(req, 4 MB)` - our own 413 under the platform's ~4.5 MB cap; inline assets must
   stay small (a logo, not a video; `SHAPE_LIMITS.assetsTotal` = 3 MB);
5. `graphicSaveShape` (`api/_lib/me/graphicShape.ts`) - a PURE shape + size guard on the
   LIBRARY RECORD the bridge built (`bridge.graphicDoc` -> `model/graphicDoc.ts newGraphicDoc`):
   version 1, a real `TemplateType`, the three sources within caps, the `SPXGCTemplateDefinition`
   marker PRESENT (a regex, never a parse), assets `{path, data:URL}` with relative paths,
   entries and fields as strings. **The template code is never parsed, evaluated or validated on
   the server** - `parseDefinition` runs the definition literal through `new Function`, and this
   function holds the service key with `fetch` as a global. The code is judged where it runs in a
   sandbox: the bridge's gate in the user's own browser before the CLI saves (the CLI refuses an
   invalid package itself), and the app's re-gate when the graphic is opened, published or
   exported;
6. `newGraphicDoc` re-stamps what a server must own: a SERVER uuid (a service-role upsert on a
   client id could overwrite another user's row), the server clock (sync's LWW reads
   `body.updatedAt` - never a client clock), `origin {tool, version}` (provenance, never proof),
   AI provenance nulled;
7. `INSERT` into `documents` (kind `graphic`, `user_id` set by the service role) - never an
   upsert; `201 { id, url }` with `url = <origin>/app#/graphic/<id>`.

The record then reaches the user's browser through the ordinary sync pull. A deep link opened
before that pull lands (`#/graphic/<id>` miss while signed in) runs ONE sync pass and retries
(`App.tsx`), so the link `noacg save` prints works on first open.

### Error table (the CLI prints the right-hand column)

| Status | Code | When | What to do |
|---|---|---|---|
| 400 | `invalid` | not a version-1 record, unknown type, no definition marker, a cap exceeded, bad JSON | fix the package; `noacg validate` |
| 401 | `unauthorized` | no credential, an unknown or REVOKED key | `noacg login` (or set `NOACG_AGENT_KEY`) |
| 403 | `forbidden` | the key does not carry `graphics:create`, or the account's entitlement withholds it (suspended, switched off) | the account owner; `docs/ADMIN.md` |
| 413 | `too_large` | body over 4 MB | keep inline assets small |
| 429 | `rate_limited` | per-IP or per-account burst | wait for `Retry-After` |
| 503 | `unavailable` | this deployment has no account backend (offline / self-host without Supabase) | zip the package and use the studio's Import door |
| 500 | `internal` | the insert failed | retry; nothing was stored |

`/api/me/agent-keys` answers the same codes: `begin` 401 without a session, 403 when an agent
key tries to mint a key; `redeem` 400 for an unknown / used / expired code or a wrong verifier
(the code is spent either way); `DELETE` 404 for a key that is not yours or already revoked.

## 4. The boundary gates (a behaviour change for everyone)

A library record may be a broken draft - the editor saves half-finished work, and the save door
stores a record the server never executed. What may NOT happen is a broken graphic reaching a
renderer somebody else is pointing a camera at. So the library->air boundary is now gated, in
the code that crosses it rather than in the dialogs that happen to show a verdict:

- `publishGate` (`src/validation/publishGate.ts`, moved from `community/gate.ts` which
  re-exports it) = `validateTemplate` + the share-safety bench, external deps and missing
  assets promoted to errors - the one gate behind the community door, the bridge's validator,
  and now:
- `publishControlShow` (`src/control/hostedControl.ts`) refuses an invalid graphic BEFORE it
  looks for a backend or pins anything to an output URL - `assertProductionGate` over the live
  library templates of the pool;
- `buildShowZip` / `buildShowZipFor` (`src/export/showExport.ts`) refuse the same way, for every
  target, whoever calls them; the production export dialog shows the same verdict
  (`productionGateFailures`) so "the button was enabled but the build refused" cannot happen.

`src/validation/productionGate.ts` is the helper both call (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §3: `control
-> validation` and `export -> validation`, `productionGate` only). **The product promise is now
literal: an invalid graphic cannot publish or export.** Pinned by `e2e/production-gate.spec.ts`.
Previously an invalid graphic in a production could be published to a hosted page and, through
the programmatic builders, exported - this closes both. Ratified by the owner 2026-08-22.

## 5. Where things live

| Piece | File |
|---|---|
| permission vocabulary, `Principal`, `permits` | `src/entitlements/permissions.ts` (pure) |
| principal resolution | `api/_lib/principal.ts` |
| key + code store (Supabase service role; in-memory for tests) | `api/_lib/agentAccessStore.ts` |
| `/api/me/agent-keys` | `api/_lib/me/agentKeys.ts` (+ `.test.ts`) |
| `/api/me/graphics` + the pure shape guard | `api/_lib/me/graphics.ts`, `graphicShape.ts` (+ `.test.ts`) |
| migration | `supabase/migrations/0050_agent_keys.sql` |
| consent page, browser client | `src/components/auth/AgentAccessConsent.tsx`, `src/backend/agentAccess.ts` |
| Settings list | `SettingsDialog.tsx` `AgentAccessSection` |
| CLI | `cli/src/auth.ts`, `cli/src/commands/{login,logout,whoami,save}.ts`, the `save` verb of the `noacg` tool in `cli/src/mcp.ts` |
| gates | `src/validation/{publishGate,productionGate}.ts` |
| specs | `e2e/agent-access.spec.ts` (offline), `e2e/configured/agent-access.spec.ts` (live), `e2e/production-gate.spec.ts` |

## 6. Stated limits

- The key sits on disk, user-ACL'd, not in a keychain (v1). Scope + revocation + `last_used_at`
  + per-user config dir is the story; a leaked key can create graphics in one library until it
  is revoked, and nothing else.
- The server stores no "validated" claim; `origin` is provenance. The gates re-run where it
  matters: the editor validates live as soon as the record is opened (its preview is a
  `sandbox="allow-scripts"` iframe, so the code runs contained), and publish / export refuse an
  invalid graphic outright (§4). What is deliberately NOT done is a screen inside the sync
  engine that refuses to land a pulled record - a refused pull would be re-pulled forever, and
  the library is allowed to hold a draft; the community importer's in-place re-gate is the model
  for a later hardening if agent-saved records ever arrive from anything but the user's own key.
- Inline assets ride in `documents.body` until the browser's next sync push externalizes them
  to Storage (the provider's ordinary path); the 3 MB cap keeps a body well inside what a row
  should hold.
- Third-party OGraf packages cannot be saved yet (`docs/AGENT_CLI.md` "Future" - package hosting
  + an OGraf host in preview/output); `noacg save` says so.
