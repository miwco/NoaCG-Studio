# The state-machine model (NOACG_ANIM version 2)

The contract for how a graphic's STATES live in the code. Phase 1 of the template-library /
state-machine / control-layer stage put the model in the schema, the runtime, the serializer
and the validator; Phase 4 added the NODE EDITOR on top (the machine graph surface,
`src/components/MachineGraph.tsx` + `src/blocks/machineEdit.ts` — see §6a); Phase 5 built the
GENERATED CONTROL PAGES on it (`docs/CONTROL_LAYER.md` — every operator event a button via
the additive `machine.controls` metadata, the event/snap transport cues, staging, the event
log, hosted control).

Companion docs: `TIMELINE_V2_PLAN.md` (the step/keyframe model this extends),
`TIMELINE_INTERACTION_MODEL.md` (the timeline's interaction contract),
`DYNAMIC_MOTION_SCOPE.md` (measured motion, which stays outside the machine).

## 1. Vocabulary

One word per idea, in code, schema, docs and UI:

| Term | What it is | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|
| **Data** | Values an operator types (names, scores, answers). | The SPX field model (`f0`, `f1`, …) - unchanged. |
| **State** | What the graphic currently looks like. Its content is a timeline. | `AnimState` |
| **Transition** | An animated change from one state to another. | `AnimTransition` |
| **Event** | Something that happened: an operator pressed a button, a timer elapsed. | `noacgDispatch(event)` / the built-ins |
| **Action** | What an operator may do RIGHT NOW - the legal events from the current state. | `animMachine.ts operatorEvents()` |
| **Guard** | Whether a transition is legal. **Structural only**: it fires if the author drew that arrow from the current state. No expression language, ever. | The dispatch loop |
| **Effect** | What entering a state does: play its timeline, arm its timer. | The interpreter |
| **Group** | One small independent graph. Several run in PARALLEL - this is what prevents state explosion. | `AnimGroup` |
| **Default path** | The ordered walk `next` follows. The SPX/CasparCG compatibility contract. | `AnimGroup.defaultPath` |

---

## 2. The shape

`src/blocks/animData.ts` is the contract. Version 2 is version 1 **plus an optional
`machine`**:

```jsonc
{
  "version": 2,
  "root": ".lower-third",
  "speed": 1,
  "steps": [ /* … unchanged: the default path's state timelines, IN WALK ORDER … */ ],
  "machine": {
    "groups": [
      {
        "id": "main",
        "initial": "off",
        "defaultPath": ["on", "out"],
        "states": [
          { "id": "off", "name": "Off" },
          { "id": "on", "name": "On" },
          { "id": "out", "name": "Out" }
        ],
        "transitions": [
          { "from": "on", "to": "out", "trigger": "operator", "event": "next" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**The positional binding is the load-bearing decision.** `defaultPath[i]`'s timeline IS
`steps[i]`. No stored indices, nothing to go stale - and every existing surface (the step
timeline, `animEdit`, `animEval`, `presetApply`, the interpreter's index walk) keeps working
unchanged, because `steps` still means exactly what it always meant. Invariant, enforced by
the shape gate: `defaultPath.length === steps.length`, waypoints unique, and a path state
never carries an inline `timeline`.

Where a state's timeline lives:

- **default-path state** - positionally, in `steps`.
- **off-path (branch) state, or any state of a non-main group** - inline, as
  `state.timeline` (a full `AnimStep`).
- **neither** - a POSE-ONLY state. Entering it plays nothing: `Off`, `Paused`, a hold.

`reveals` / `hides` are the ordered walk's pre-hide and early-exit mechanics, so they are
confined to `steps`; an inline timeline carrying either is off-shape. A branch state's
visibility is its own keyframes' business.

**Triggers.** `operator` (an `event` name) and `timer` (`after`, speed-relative seconds from
the state's entry timeline settling). `data-condition` is RESERVED: it parses, is round-tripped
canonically, warns in validation, and never fires. At most one timer transition per from-state,
so auto-advance is deterministic; one `(from, event)` pair per group, so dispatch is never
ambiguous.

**`style` / `duration` / `ease` on a transition** are the node editor's TRANSITION STYLES
(`fade`, `push-left/right/up/down`, `wipe-left/right` — `TRANSITION_STYLES` in animData.ts):
the arrow's own animated change, played by the interpreter's `noacgStyleTimeline` INSTEAD of
the target state's entry timeline. Two phases on the root around an instant pose swap composed
by the SNAP recipe (clear, then replay each group's canonical route with suppressed callbacks),
so a styled entry and a snap agree on every pose — including pose-only branch states, whose
look lives on the route rather than on the target. `duration` is the change's total
speed-relative seconds (default 0.6), `ease` each half's GSAP ease (default power2.inOut). An
unknown style round-trips untouched, warns in validation, and the entry timeline plays instead.
The PAIRING RULE (§5) covers styles: a styled arrow under an interpreter without
`noacgStyleTimeline` is an export-blocking error, and `writeAnimData` re-emits the region
rather than splice into one.

**`at` on a state** is the node editor's box position `[x, y]` — additive optional (no version
bump), read by nothing but the graph view; absent means auto-layout.

**Reserved events.** `play` and `stop` are built-in and never authorable. `next` is NOT
reserved - it is an ordinary event name, conventionally the default path's arrows, and a branch
state may author its own `next` edge as the rejoin arrow.

---

## 3. Semantics

**Data never transitions.** `update(data)` writes fields and returns. State changes happen only
through events. A payload may RIDE an accepted event (`noacgDispatch('select', { f5: 'B' })` -
applied through the same `setFieldValue` path, and only when the guard accepts), which is what
makes a multi-part change atomic. A bare `update()` still moves nothing.

**Entering a state plays its timeline.** Re-entry replays it - including a SELF-transition,
which is how a ticker's cycle beat works without duplicating a state.

**The built-ins** (what SPX, CasparCG, OGraf, OBS overlays and the editor all call):

| Global | Machine meaning |
|---|---|
| `play()` | Reset every group to its initial state, clear the queue, play the entrance, arm the first waypoint's timer. |
| `next()` | Advance the default path: fire the arrow toward the next waypoint (whatever event name it carries). Off-path, fire an authored `next` rejoin arrow if the author drew one, else a deterministic no-op. Exhausted, or off air: `null`. |
| `stop()` | The reserved out - legal from EVERY state. Cancel timers, flush the queue, play the exit, rest every group at its initial state. |
| `update(data)` | Fields only. Stays outside the queue (it is already synchronous and atomic). Phase 5's event log records updates as COMMANDS (panel log + the hosted control_events table) without changing this runtime semantic. |

**Guarding is structural.** An event with no arrow from any group's current state is dropped
silently, payload and all. "Reveal cannot fire before Lock" is true because the author never
drew a Reveal arrow from anywhere but Locked - not because an expression said so.

**The serial queue.** One event at a time, FIFO, one queue per graphic. A dispatch that arrives
during a drain (from a `tl.call`, say) queues behind it. Several groups may answer one event -
they fire in declaration order. Pointers move SYNCHRONOUSLY at dispatch; animations play
asynchronously, so an event arriving mid-transition evaluates against the NEW state and
interrupts by finishing the previous group timeline instantly with suppressed callbacks.

**Timers** are `gsap.delayedCall`, armed by a `tl.call` at the end of the entry timeline - never
`setTimeout`. That one choice buys three things at once: the bench's `timeScale` accelerates
timer states for free, the render pipeline's virtual clock drives them deterministically, and
GSAP's own callback suppression means a settled or scrubbed graphic **never arms a timer** and
so can never auto-advance under the user.

**Snap** (`noacgSnap(assignments, opts)`) enters states INSTANTLY: kill timelines/timers/tweens,
flush the queue, `clearProps` the root subtree, re-arm the reveal pre-hides, then replay each
group's canonical path with `progress(1, true)` (suppressed callbacks - clocks and loops stay
silent). `null` assignments means every group to its initial: that is **reset visual state**, the
counterpart of resetting DATA (`resetSampleData` / `update`). The two are never conflated.
Timers arm afterwards by default (recovery semantics: a snapped-into ticker resumes cycling);
the editor's preview passes `{ timers: false }` so a parked design view stays parked.

The **canonical path** to a state: for a main-group waypoint, the default-path prefix; otherwise
BFS shortest path from the group's initial over the walk's own edges plus authored transitions,
ties broken by declaration order. Deterministic by construction. A state whose pose genuinely
depends on the arrival route is a Phase 1 limitation, not a promise - the node editor can
surface it later. `blocks/animMachine.ts canonicalPath` and the interpreter's
`noacgCanonicalPath` implement the same rule and must stay in agreement (the `animEval`
precedent).

**Reset is two operations.** Visual: `noacgSnap(null)`. Data: the field values. Never one call.

**Parameterize with data, not states.** A quiz's "answer B selected" is ONE `Selected` state plus
a `selectedAnswer` field - never four near-identical states. State counts stay small; data
carries the variation. The acceptance suite pins this.

---

## 4. The implicit machine

A template with no `machine` key IS a one-group linear machine, derived on read and **never
persisted**: states named after the steps, a synthesized pose-only `off` as initial, an operator
`next` arrow along the path, and - for exact version-1 parity - NO arrow into the final Out
(`next()` no-ops when only Out remains; `stop()` takes the graphic out). An explicit machine MAY
author that last arrow, which is how a hand-written template opts into "next alone drives it
end to end".

Two implementations, one rule: `blocks/animMachine.ts deriveMachine` (editor side) and the
interpreter's `noacgMachine` IIFE (runtime side). They must name the same states.

The whole existing catalog therefore gained `noacgDispatch` / `noacgSnap` / `noacgMachineState`
without a single template file changing.

---

## 5. Format versioning (the doctrine)

- The `version` field states which schema the block speaks.
- **Additive optional fields never bump it.** A strict validator lists what it checks, not what
  it forbids.
- **A breaking shape change bumps it and ships its migration in `parseAnimData` the same
  commit.** With a large catalog this is non-negotiable.
- **`parseAnimData` is a NORMALIZING parse**: a valid version-1 block migrates on read
  (`migrateAnimData`), so everything downstream sees only the current shape.
- **Serialization always writes the current version.** One canonical shape, one fixed-point
  proof. A saved version-1 document flips on its first edit - a one-line diff, and that IS its
  migration moment.
- **An unknown version degrades to hand-crafted**, read-only, never a crash. An older build
  reading a newer synced document loses no data.

**The frozen-interpreter pairing rule.** `spliceAnimData` replaces only the data literal, so a
saved template keeps whatever interpreter it was emitted with. Machine-bearing data must never
land under an interpreter that predates the machine engine: check
`animRuntime.ts hasMachineRuntime(js)` first and re-emit the whole region
(`replaceRegionWithAnimData`) when it is false. The `hides` early-exit shipped the same way.
`validateTemplate` treats a mismatch as an export-blocking error.

---

## 6. What the model deliberately does not do (yet)

- **Control-layer generation SHIPPED (Phase 5, docs/CONTROL_LAYER.md).** The transports grew
  `event`/`snap` cues that forward to `noacgDispatch`/`noacgSnap`; the queue still lives
  INSIDE the template — the serial guarantee holds identically in the editor, in an exported
  overlay, under SPX, and under every control page. `update()` stays outside the queue; the
  event log records commands panel-side (and in the hosted command log) rather than changing
  the runtime's update semantics.
- **Dynamic collections, data-condition triggers, interruption priorities, external feeds,
  operator permissions, nested machines** - all consciously deferred. The schema does not block
  any of them.

## 6a. The node editor (Phase 4 — shipped)

The machine GRAPH surface, toggling with the step timeline in the bottom dock (Rive-style):
`src/components/MachineGraph.tsx` over the pure mutators in `src/blocks/machineEdit.ts`.

- **One generic editor for every graphic.** A template without an authored machine shows its
  DERIVED machine, labelled "derived from the steps"; the first graph edit MATERIALIZES exactly
  that machine into the literal (`machineEdit.ts withExplicitMachine`), inside the same
  undoable apply — behaviourally a no-op at the moment it happens.
- **Reading:** default path as the amber spine (badged ▶ » ■ like the timeline's cue markers,
  the un-authored edge into the final waypoint dashed as stop's), branches as labelled arrows,
  parallel groups as lanes, the preview's live state highlighted (the simulator chip's poll).
  Clicking a state SNAPS the preview there, parked (`{ timers: false }`).
- **Editing:** port-drag draws an operator arrow (minted unique event, selected for renaming);
  cards edit trigger / event / timer delay / transition style; states and groups add and
  delete; boxes drag to `at` positions. Deleting the only arrow behind a default-path edge is
  REFUSED (judged by validateMachine — one of two parallel arrows may still go). Every write
  goes mutator → `writeAnimData` → ONE applyTemplate; illegal edits return null and the UI
  reverts in place.
- **Waypoints belong to the timeline.** The positional binding means a path state and its clip
  are one thing, so the graph never adds or deletes waypoints — the card says so and offers
  "Open its timeline" (surface swap, playhead parked at the step).
- **Break fearlessly:** the topbar ↺ Reset restores the create-time `baseline` snapshot.

Pinned by `e2e/machine-graph.spec.ts` (the goals doc's acceptance walk, the styled-change pose
landing, and the styles pairing rule).
