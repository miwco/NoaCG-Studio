asked: "The wizard instruction file being at 99% is exactly the kind of problem I expect you to solve autonomously. Compact/modularize it without losing important instructions. More broadly, all our instruction/context files keep growing, so we need a systematic way to remove stale information and modularize them before this becomes a recurring problem."
note: d399b612 landed the contract-staleness gate and the root AGENTS.md is 11 KB lighter; the orchestrator chain is still at its ceiling and the evidence-date idea is untouched

**2026-09-03 - part 1 done, and part 3 has its first mechanical test.** `claude/a-agents-md-headroom`
took 11,343 bytes out of the root `AGENTS.md`, which all 52 chains load: the repository map and the
ten-page URL table to `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, the incident behind each git rule to a new
`docs/BRANCHING_AND_LANDING.md`, and two verification rules back to `docs/VERIFICATION.md`, which
already held their measurements. Nothing was deleted - an audit script checked every removed line
against the file that received it. `src/components/wizard` went from 365 bytes free to 9,708, the
chains over 80% went from ten to one, and the ceiling ratcheted 112,000 -> 110,000.

**Part 2 is done by arithmetic rather than by sweeping.** The nine other chains that printed the
warning were all paying for the same root file; none of them needs its own pass now.

**Part 3's staleness pass turns out to be cheap and worth wiring as a gate.** Extracting every
backticked token from a contract and checking each path and symbol against the tree took a
twenty-line script and answered "is any of this describing something that no longer exists?" for
three contracts in seconds - the answer was no for all three, which is itself the finding that
stopped the wizard file being cut further. It belongs in `npm run build` beside
`check-docs-index`. The evidence-date idea is untouched.

**2026-09-04 - the owner's four cuts landed, and they are the end of what editing buys.** The
sibling receipt `agents-md-byte-headroom` closed with them. The wizard chain went 91.2% -> 89.6%
(100,292 -> 98,541 bytes used, 11,459 free) and the templates chains 79.5% -> 77.2%. **The 85% that
receipt aimed at is not reachable from those cuts, and the measurement says why**: a
sentence-coverage pass over the rewritten Import/SVG block found 4 of its 54 sentences present in
`docs/SVG_IMPORT_PLAN.md` or `docs/IMPORT_MVP.md`, and all four are rules the ruling says to keep.
The wizard's contract is not restating those plans - it holds rules they do not. Combined with the
2026-09-03 findings that the file is not stale and has no split (a child contract under `wizard/`
loads on TOP of it, not instead of it), **the remaining levers are structural, not editorial**:
moving the import steps out from under this contract in the source tree, or content
`src/components/AGENTS.md` gives up. Neither is a byte problem, so neither should be started to make
a percentage. **Free bytes is the honest measure, not the percentage** - 365 free on 2026-09-02,
11,459 now.

One thing worth knowing before the next pass: **a delegate will hit a byte target by deleting
symbols**. The Codex run that did these cuts reached the number exactly and dropped 17 backticked
names that live in no other file (`withUniversalMotion`, `proposeFollowers`, `svgFitNodes`,
`assets/svgGeometry.ts`, `.wz-help-strip` among them), pointing at a section that did not contain
them. A line-level diff audit cannot catch that, because the prose was rewritten rather than moved;
what caught it was extracting every backticked token from the pre-edit file and checking each one
against the post-edit file and the receiving docs. **That symbol-survival check is the instrument
this work needs**, and it is the same shape as the staleness pass below.

**2026-09-05 - the staleness gate landed** as `scripts/check-contract-freshness.mjs`, part of
`npm run build`. It scans every `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` chain and every workflow markdown, and
fails the build on a backticked `scripts/...`, `docs/...`, source path or `npm run` reference that
names something git does not have - the mechanical half of part 3, so a contract can be trimmed
without leaving a dangling pointer that rots unread. It exempts glob and placeholder patterns,
gitignored generated files (via `git check-ignore`, so the verdict matches CI), and the
transient-by-design directories (`docs/handoffs/`, `docs/backlog/`, `docs/acceptance/`). On the day
it landed the only durable rot it found across 131 contracts was already fixed or gitignored.

**What is still open:** the `.agent-workflows/orchestrator*` common path, at 640 of 640 lines, which
still blocks the orchestrator half of `docs/backlog/memory-store-drain.md` and wants the
planner/watcher session split the 2026-09-05 orchestrator review proposes; and the evidence-date
idea. The byte-reserve gate landed 2026-09-03 - `scripts/check-shared-instructions.mjs` fails the
build once a chain has less than 4 KB free.

# Instruction files only ever grow, and nothing removes what stopped being true

**Filed:** 2026-09-03. **Source:** owner ruling, after two sessions in two days routed around a
full instruction chain rather than reporting it.

## Why

The contracts are load-bearing: an agent reads them before touching an area, and a rule that does
not fit in the window is a rule that does not fire. Today the mechanism only pushes one way. Every
session that learns something adds a paragraph, and **nothing anywhere removes one.** The byte
ceiling then converts an editorial problem into a build failure at the worst possible moment - the
next session to touch that area.

The measured state on 2026-09-03, from `npm run check:shared-instructions`:

| chain | used | free | |
|---|---|---|---|
| `src/components/wizard` | 111635 | **365** | **99.7%** |
| `src/templates/importedDesign` | 98825 | 13175 | 88.2% |
| `src/templates/types` | 95250 | 16750 | 85.0% |
| `src/templates/infographics` | 94007 | 17993 | 83.9% |
| `src/templates/lowerThirds` | 93826 | 18174 | 83.8% |

**And it is not only the AGENTS.md chains.** Writing this file's own rules into the orchestrator
contract on 2026-09-03 pushed its always-loaded common path to **640 of 640 lines - exactly the
ceiling, zero headroom** - and getting there required condensing two existing sections and moving a
third into a branch module. The next rule added to that contract fails the build. So the shrinking
mechanism is owed to `.agent-workflows/orchestrator*` on the same terms as the AGENTS.md chains,
and the same trap applies: the cheap response to a full contract is to file the rule somewhere it
does not belong.

Ten chains sit over 80%. The wizard chain has **365 bytes** - roughly four lines. A 2026-09-02
session (row H) spent 244 of them and deliberately filed its new contract in a different directory
to avoid the ceiling; a second (row E) had already done the same the day before. **Two sessions in
two days worked around the limit instead of reporting it**, which is how a warning stops being a
warning: the cheapest response to a full file is to put the rule somewhere it does not belong, and
the contract then rots by dispersal rather than by deletion.

## What it would take

Three parts, and the third is the one that stops this recurring.

1. **Buy real headroom on the wizard chain now.** Not a trim to get under the warning - that games
   the measurement, which the 2026-09-02 headroom session explicitly refused to do. Move whole
   sections into the directory they actually describe, the way the eight template categories were
   split on 2026-09-02: the people editing that code still load it, every sibling stops paying.
2. **Sweep the other nine chains over 80%** with the same method. `condense-doc` is the skill for
   the editorial half; the structural half is the split.
3. **Give the contracts a way to SHRINK, which is the missing half.** Candidates, in the order a
   session should judge them:
   - A **staleness pass** with a real test: for each rule, does the thing it describes still exist?
     A rule naming a file, function, script or flag that is gone is not a judgement call - it is
     mechanically detectable, and `check-docs-index` already proves that shape of check works.
   - An **evidence date** on rules that record an incident, so a reader can tell a live constraint
     from a war story. Not automatic deletion - the war stories are often the most valuable lines -
     but visible age makes the review possible.
   - The **ceiling should fail loudly rather than warn**. Both halves landed 2026-09-03, in that
     order - the headroom first, then the failure, because landing the gate first would have
     converted every wizard row into a red build. The gate fires on a 4 KB byte RESERVE rather
     than the 99% the receipt originally asked for; the reasoning is in the reserve's own comment
     in `scripts/check-shared-instructions.mjs`.

## Ambiguity goes to the owner as a one-line walk question, never as a blocker

The owner ruled on 2026-09-03: *"If there are genuinely ambiguous content decisions, put simple
questions in the walk such as 'Is this still relevant?' or 'Can this be removed?' I can answer
those quickly. They should not block the work."* So a section whose relevance a session genuinely
cannot judge is filed as a `kind: walk-p` owner-queue item quoting the section, and **the rest of
the compaction ships in the same commit.** Waiting for the answer is the failure mode.

## Evidence

- `npm run check:shared-instructions`, 2026-09-03 - the table above.
- `docs/handoffs/2026-09-02-e-agents-md-headroom.md` - the 2026-09-02 session that took the warning
  count from 17 of 39 chains to 10 of 52, moved prose verbatim rather than retyping it, and refused
  to trim a row purely to get a number back under the line.
- Row H's handoff, 2026-09-02: spent 244 bytes and filed its contract elsewhere.
- Owner receipts `agents-md-byte-headroom` and `agents-md-warning-fails-at-99`, both closed by
  2026-09-04; `node scripts/owner-receipts.mjs --closed` reads them back out of git.
