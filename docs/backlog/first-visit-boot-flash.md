# A first-ever visit to `/app` still flashes the editor on its way to the wizard

**Filed:** 2026-09-02, from the route-transition-flash branch
(`docs/handoffs/2026-09-02-g-route-transition-flash.md`), which closed the same defect for every
other boot. This is the one case left, and it is left deliberately.

## Why

It is the same frame the owner complained about on 2026-08-28, on the one boot that belongs to a
reader who has never used the product before. Every other boot is fixed and pinned by
`e2e/route-transition-flash.spec.ts`; this one is not pinned at all, because a test asserting the
wrong behaviour would only make it harder to see. First impressions are the whole point of that
boot: it is the wizard-first entry the student release is built around.

## What is happening

`decideBootRoute` in `src/App.tsx` settles every boot at module load except this one. A bare
`/app` with **no autosaved project** resolves to the wizard, and that decision is still made by
the small mount effect further down the file. An effect runs after the first commit is painted,
so `''` parses as the editor, `<AppShell/>` renders, and the redirect to `#/new` lands a frame
later.

## Why it was not simply moved

It was moved, measured working, and then backed out. Resolving it at module load means the route
already says `new` when React first renders, which changes **which surface renders under the
wizard** - `bootedOnWizard` reads the arrival URL, so a bare `/app` gets Home underneath rather
than nothing. With Home mounted under the wizard, `e2e/layout.spec.ts:171` ("mobile: Home leads
with Productions...") failed on CI: its `home-page` visibility gate passes while the wizard is
still up, and it then clicked Home's dashboard door into the wizard's backdrop until it timed out
- 27 retries over 60 s, so a stuck state rather than a race.

**It would not reproduce on this laptop.** The whole spec file passed, the single test passed, and
a reduction of that exact walk (bare `/app` boot onto the wizard, seed a graphic and a show, move
to `#/home`, check the wizard is gone) passed both with and without the speculative fix that was
tried - which is what proved the hypothesis wrong rather than confirming it. Two of three CI runs
failed it; the one that passed had the other `bootedOnWizard` reading.

## Where to start

The correlation is mechanical and worth trusting as a lead rather than a conclusion: the failure
tracks which surface sits under the wizard on that boot, not the route decision itself. So the
question to answer first is **why leaving `#/new` does not close a boot-opened wizard on CI**, and
the honest way to answer it is on a Linux runner, not here. `routedWizard` in `src/App.tsx` is
only ever set inside the effect's `route.view === 'new'` branch; initialising it from the boot was
tried and is NOT the answer (the reduction passes without it).

Once that is understood, the change itself is small, and
`e2e/route-transition-flash.spec.ts` already carries the instrument: a MutationObserver installed
before the first commit that records every surface the first time it enters the DOM. Add the case
back as `expect(seen).not.toContain('editor')` on a fresh profile.
