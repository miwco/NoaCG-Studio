# Drain the memory store down to its charter

**Filed:** 2026-09-03. **Source:** owner ruling. The ARCHITECTURE landed the same day
(`docs/MISTAKE_TRIGGERS.md` "Memory: the weakest trigger", the rewritten `MEMORY.md` header, and
the extended `~/.claude/hooks/memory-audit.mjs`). **This item is the migration, not the design.**

## Why

The physics are fixed; the store is not. Measured 2026-09-03 by the upgraded audit hook:

| | before | after phase 1 | target |
|---|---|---|---|
| corpus | 182 KB / 49 entries | **97 KB / 30 entries** | 40 KB |
| entries claiming the retired `exit: never` | 41 | **0** | 0 |
| entries declaring `strength:` | 0 of 49 | **30 of 30** | all |
| `[[link]]` targets that do not exist | 42 | **0** | 0 |
| index | 61 lines, 20 links to deleted files | **59 lines, 0 dead** | under 60 |

**PHASE 1 IS DONE (2026-09-03, `10c48375`)** and every row above except the corpus is closed. What
shipped: four dated `owner-decisions` files plus the operator stories moved verbatim to
`docs/OWNER_RULINGS.md`; two receipts became backlog files (`open-threads-from-the-memory-cull.md`,
`wave-leftovers-2026-08-27.md`); seven money entries became one `money.md`; and four entries the
root `AGENTS.md` already carried in full were deleted after checking each phrase was really there
(`landing-is-serialized`, `commit-message-style`, `client-agnostic-and-no-mandatory-slots`, plus
`lite-brand-plan`, which summarised `docs/AI_LITE_BRAND_PLAN.md`). `merge-cost-is-the-bottleneck`
was retired into `fast-iteration-phase` with its premise marked lapsed.

**PHASE 2 IS BLOCKED, and this is the whole of what is left.** Ten entries are marked `(route)` in
the index: they are contract-shaped rules that belong in the `AGENTS.md` or workflow that loads
where they fire - and **every instruction chain is at its byte ceiling**, so there is nowhere to put
them. `src/components/wizard` has 365 bytes free and the orchestrator's always-loaded path is at
640/640. **Do `docs/backlog/instruction-files-need-a-shrinking-mechanism.md` first**; this item
cannot finish before it. The residual after routing is the four big direction entries
(`owner-taste-rules-instrument`, `adapt-first-create-with-ai`, `owner-walk-agent-round-ux`,
`gtm-competitive`, ~28 KB between them), which want trimming rather than moving.

**A manual cleanup has already been tried and did not hold.** 203 entries were archived on
2026-08-25; nine days later the store was back to 49 entries and 168 KB, about five a day. So the
drain only pays off underneath the new rules - do the routing, not another cull.

## What it would take

Order matters; step 1 is what makes the rest safe.

1. **Map the graph before deleting anything.** `landing-is-serialized` has six inbound `[[links]]`
   and its content is already in root `AGENTS.md`; deleting the file naively creates six more
   dangling links, which is the fault being fixed. Deletion is a GRAPH operation: repoint inbound
   links at the live entry or at the repo doc that now holds the fact, then remove.
2. **Route by the charter, entry by entry.** For each: can it fire at a MOMENT? If yes it is a
   hook, a gate, or the contract that loads there - move the content and delete the memory. If no,
   it stays and gets `decided:`, `strength:` and `holds-while:`. Verified duplicates found so far,
   both safe once their links are repointed: `commit-message-style` and `landing-is-serialized`
   (both fully covered by root `AGENTS.md`).
3. **Drain the eight dated receipt files** - `owner-decisions-2026-08-08/27/29/30`,
   `wave-leftovers-2026-08-27`, `operator-stories-2026-08-27`, `open-threads`,
   `next-wave-candidate-rows`. These are meeting minutes: live rulings buried inside dead detail,
   which is exactly where a lapsed opinion later reads as a standing rule. `MEMORY.md` was already
   tracking one supersession in PROSE inside an index line ("machines bullet superseded"). Extract
   each live ruling to its own subject entry; delete the receipt. Git keeps the minutes.
4. **Fix the 42 dangling links** as a sweep once 1-3 are done, since those steps change the set.
5. **Re-run the hook until it is quiet.** It reports every one of these numbers, so "done" is a
   measurement rather than a feeling.

## Interview, not review

The owner ruled he will not read every file: *"interview me only where you find genuine ambiguity
or conflicts."* So a session doing this asks him ONLY where routing is genuinely undecidable, one
line each, batched as `kind: walk-p` owner-queue items ("is this still relevant?", "does this newer
rule replace this older one?"). **Ambiguity never blocks the drain** - route it, mark
`strength: preference` so it cannot bind, and ship the rest.

Two entries already checked and NOT ambiguous, recorded so they are not re-litigated:
`one-orchestrator-at-a-time` and `ai-gallery-sameness-verdict` are both well written, state their
why, their evidence and their own revisit test. The store's problem is systemic, not per-file - do
not arrive expecting to find bad memories.

## Evidence

- `node ~/.claude/hooks/memory-audit.mjs` - every number in the table above.
- `C:\claude\memory-archive-2026-08-25\` - 203 files, the cleanup that did not hold.
- `docs/MISTAKE_TRIGGERS.md` "Memory: the weakest trigger" - the charter, the precedence order and
  the chip-rule incident that showed a recorded, loaded, agreed-with rule can still never fire.
