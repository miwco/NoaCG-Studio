# AI platform plan - one workflow for all AI assistance

> **PARKED 2026-08-08 - superseded by `src/ai/AGENTS.md`, `docs/AI_PROVIDER_GATEWAY.md` and
> `docs/AI_TASK_REGISTRY.md`.** The stages this plan proposed are built and their contracts are
> owned by those three files. Retained for the ratified decisions it records (the disclosure
> notice, who-pays-decides-the-route, the wrong-kind blocking ruling), which live code still
> cites by section number. Nothing here is current strategy.

**Status: PLAN RATIFIED (2026-07-28).** Sections 1-3 and 5 are a verified audit of the tree
at audit time; sections 4-14 are the reviewed design. The owner decisions in section 15 were
ratified 2026-07-28 and supersede the corresponding proposals earlier in the document (marked
in place). What has been built is recorded in `docs/GOALS_ARCHIVE.md` ("The AI platform"); what
is still open is the tier ladder in `docs/GOALS.md`. Binding
neighbours: `docs/AI_PROVIDER_GATEWAY.md` (the gateway contract),
`src/ai/AGENTS.md` (the SPX harness doctrine), `docs/AI_LITE_BENCHMARK.md` (the Lite bench),
`docs/IMPORT_MVP.md` (the manual import contract this plan extends, never replaces).

The question this plan answers: **can NoaCG Lite become the shared foundation for all
lightweight AI assistance, or do some workloads need separate task harnesses on the same
gateway?** The evidence-based answer (section 3): Lite the *harness* stays a specialist;
Lite the *infrastructure* (server-owned profile, allowlist, quota ledger, ZDR policy,
benchmark pattern) generalizes into a task registry that every harness shares.

## 1. Current AI assistance inventory (verified repository facts)

Every workflow goes through one transport: browser harness -> `src/ai/modelGateway.ts` ->
`POST /api/ai/generate` (or the Lite endpoint) -> `api/_lib/aiGateway.ts` adapters
(Anthropic Messages, OpenAI Responses, OpenRouter Chat Completions). Structured output is
schema-revalidated server-side. There is **no provider-specific branch in any harness**.

### 1.1 SPX graphic generation (src/ai, entry: wizard AiStep + editor AIPromptPanel)

| # | Surface | Input | Output contract | Model route | Validation / repair | Tier |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| W1 | Create with AI, harness ON (default): `generateAlternatives` | brief, last 10 talk turns, images + style references (<=3, base64, no SVG), palette, custom font, optional `GenerationSpec`, seed spec | `emit_design_alternatives` -> 3 `DesignSpec`; catalog-fit specs assemble deterministically, custom specs go to the coder (`emit_template`) | client-selected; default `anthropic:claude-sonnet-5` | injected `productionSpxValidator` (static + runtime bench + safety screen); grounded: 0 repair rounds; custom: 2 rounds, re-validated | hosted: signed-in; offline/BYO-key: open |
| W2 | Harness OFF: `generateRaw` | same | one `emit_template` call, `RAW_SYSTEM` | same | static only, **no bench, no repair** (deliberate baseline) | same |
| W3 | **NoaCG Lite** | brief <=2000 ch, <=6 turns, compact `LiteGenerationSpec` (<=2 fields), palette, font descriptor, resolution; **no images** | `LiteDecision`: one allowlisted catalog `LiteDesignSpec` or typed `unsupported` | **server-owned**: `openrouter:google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite` primary, `openrouter:qwen/qwen3-coder-next` fallback (env-overridable) | regex pre-screen + server semantic validation (roles, intent, contrast) + 1 server repair within a 2-attempt ceiling + client compile through `lite/pipeline.ts` + full bench; bench failure = platform failure, never model-repaired | free, signed-in, quota'd |
| W4 | Spec-level refine (`modify` + spec) | prompt + prior DesignSpec + house-shaped template | new `DesignSpec` -> deterministic re-assembly | client-selected | as W1 grounded | as W1 |
| W5 | Code-level modify / "Fix these" | prompt + template code | `emit_template` | client-selected | injected validator, 2 repair rounds | as W1 |
| W6 | "3 more like this" (seeded alternatives) | seed `DesignSpec` | as W1 | client-selected | as W1 | as W1; hidden in Lite |
| W7 | Lite refine | prior spec via `/api/ai/lite/generations` | `LiteDecision` | server-owned | as W3 | as W3 |
| W8 | Convert imported .html/.zip | deterministically parsed template (never raw bytes) | `emit_template` | client-selected | injected validator, `source` exempts pre-existing constructs, 2 rounds | as W1; blocked in Lite |
| W9 | Brainstorm ("Talk it through") | conversation | plain text ending `BRIEF:` | client-selected | none (text) | BYO/advanced only; hidden in Lite |
| W10 | **Editor AI panel** (Generate/Modify/Fix/Explain/Make SPX-ready) | prompt + current template | `emit_template` / text | client-selected | at audit time: static `validateTemplate` only - **fixed 2026-07-28**: the panel now injects `productionSpxValidator` (bench + safety in the repair loop), `mergeSafety` stays the display belt | signed-in (hosted) |
| W11 | Polish stage (internal) | grounded template + flourish | bounded CSS/HTML patch, `applyPolish` gatekeeper, reverts on failure | client-selected | bench re-run; revert on fail | inside W1/W4; never Lite |
| W12 | Offline stub provider | keyword match | same `specToTemplate` pipeline, no model | none | caller-side | everyone (no key) |

### 1.2 Video generation (src/ai/video + src/video)

| # | Surface | Stages | Model route | Validation / repair |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| V1 | Video generation (Remotion / HyperFrames) | keyword skill detect (model call only on zero match, `modelRole:'fast'`) -> Motion Director (`emit_motion_plan`, ~3k-token system) -> engine coder (`emit_remotion_module` / `emit_hyperframes_composition`, ~5k-token system, `cacheSystem`) -> 2 bounded repair rounds | client-selected; per-project `aiModel` free-text override | all deterministic: compile, static contract (FORBIDDEN tables), live probe at 3 frames, readability at HOLD frames (`textChecks.js`), persistence filter, soft-finding demotion. **No telemetry, no safety screen** (mitigated structurally: opaque-origin sandbox) |
| V2 | Video refine | skips Director; 1-3 calls | same | same |

Video is gated by sign-in (hosted) + key availability; **no quota, rate limit, or ledger**.
Vision input: up to 3 project images to Director and coder (no downscaling, no size budget).

### 1.3 Server infrastructure

- `api/_lib/aiGateway.ts`: 3 `ProviderAdapter`s, explicit-fallback-only routing, bounded
  retry/timeout, schema revalidation, cost estimation (`AI_MODEL_PRICING_JSON` +
  OpenRouter-reported cost). Wire types are Anthropic-shaped (content blocks, tool-style
  `StructuredOutput`); other adapters translate.
- `api/_lib/aiLiteProfile.ts` + `aiLiteStore*` + `aiLiteRateLimit.ts`: the **only** policy
  layer in the repo. Server-owned routes + per-`provider:model` price table + fail-closed
  configuration + OpenRouter policy (`zdr`, `data_collection:'deny'`, endpoint allowlist,
  price ceilings) + quotas (3 successes/day, 20/month, concurrency, $25/day fleet spend,
  $0.007/call ceiling with up-front worst-case reservation) + IP burst gate + durable
  content-free `ai_generations` ledger (migrations 0010, 0011).
- `POST /api/ai/generate` has **none of that**: any `{provider, model}` string from the
  browser, no allowlist, no quota, no rate limit, no cost ceiling, no ledger row, no
  logging, no ZDR policy. Managed key requires sign-in (when Supabase configured); a BYO
  sealed-cookie key bypasses auth entirely. This is the largest asymmetry in the system.
- BYO keys: AES-256-GCM sealed HttpOnly cookie (`api/_lib/aiCredentials.ts`), all three
  providers, one-way localStorage migration, `check-client-secrets.mjs` build gate.
- **No server-side observability on `/api/ai/generate`** - zero log lines, zero rows.
  Client telemetry (`src/ai/telemetry.ts`) is SPX-only and localStorage-only.

### 1.4 Benchmark and evaluation infrastructure

- `scripts/ai-compare.mjs` - 4-arm harness value proof (raw / raw+iterate / pre-harness /
  harness), neutral bench, overlap detector, diversity tripwire. Spends tokens, no cost cap.
- `scripts/ai-bench.mjs` - single-arm off-catalog brief bank + gallery. Spends tokens.
- `scripts/video-bench.mjs` - drives real wizard example chips, hold-frame readability,
  `--stub` free mode. Spends tokens.
- `scripts/ai-lite-*.mjs` + `scripts/ai-lite-bench/` - the model-evaluation harness:
  versioned fixture bank (24 briefs), core/holdout/repair/challenge suites, gold-ceiling +
  seeded-floor calibration, blind human gallery with test-retest, 22-code failure taxonomy,
  pipeline-identity manifests, paid runner with hard caps (40 calls / $1.50). The paid
  OpenRouter **discovery funnel** (`bench:discover/qualify/confirm/compare` - structured
  output support, ZDR, pricing, provider pinning per candidate) is designed but deferred.
- The skin path (merged 2026-07-28, server flag `AI_LITE_SKIN_ENABLED` off by default):
  neutral `ltc01` canvas, polish-gate CSS overrides, silent revert to the house chassis;
  plus `bench:sameness` (pairwise visual-distance tripwire).

### 1.5 Explicit negatives, duplication, dead code, bypasses

- **Import Graphic is fully manual** - `docs/IMPORT_MVP.md:25`: "no AI anywhere in it".
  No `src/ai` import in any of its steps. Community, showchat, assets (palette extraction,
  erase), teach/, control/, export/, render/ have **zero** AI touchpoints.
- **Duplicated across SPX and video** (no shared code): the 2-round repair loop, the
  injected-validator seam (`SpxValidator` vs `VideoValidator`), the forced-tool prompt
  scaffold ("contract + principles + one canonical example"), progress reporting, stub
  providers. Video lacks telemetry and the safety screen.
- **Duplicated inside video**: two ~5 kB contracts with ~40% shared prose, the same
  example design authored twice, two near-identical FORBIDDEN tables, two dead-control
  checks, two probe bridges.
- **Duplicated between harness and Lite**: `catalogDigest()` (generated, ~12k tokens) vs
  hand-authored `LITE_CATALOG` digest (~650 tokens) - a variant changing `maxLines`/`logo`
  silently diverges from Lite's contract; `SPEC_INPUT_SCHEMA` vs Lite `specSchema` (~80%
  overlap); `DesignSpec` vs `LiteDesignSpec` bridged by one unchecked cast.
- **Bypass paths**: W2 raw (documented, deliberate); **W10 editor panel** (undocumented -
  no bench, no safety in repair); Lite server output benched only client-side (by design).
- **Dead / inert**: `referenceSelect.ts` scoring machinery behind `SELECTION_MODE='legacy'`
  (plus a write-only recency ledger), `modelRole:'fast'` unused by SPX, Lite logo path
  (`limits.logos = 0` hardcoded), `LiteDesignSpec` category members beyond lower-third,
  `resetLiteGenerationStoreForTests`, `configuredProviders`, stale HyperFrames parity
  comment in `playerBridge.ts`, stale Anthropic-only copy in `AIPromptPanel`.
  **Stage 0 cleanup (2026-07-28)**: `resetLiteGenerationStoreForTests`, the unused
  `configuredProviders`/`providerConfigured` gateway exports, the stale `playerBridge.ts`
  comment, and the `AIPromptPanel` copy are gone. Deliberately KEPT: the `referenceSelect.ts`
  machinery (doc-pinned experiment infrastructure - `BROADCAST_DESIGN_SYSTEM_RESEARCH.md`
  §8.3f keeps every arm compilable, and the recency ledger is read by
  `referenceCards.ts`), `modelRole:'fast'` (the video provider uses it), and the Lite
  logo/category members (removing them changes the Lite schema/prompt - Stage 1
  behavior-identity territory, not hygiene).
- **No consent/disclosure UI exists anywhere.** `.env.example` references a "Lite
  first-use retention notice" that is not in the repo.
- **No paid tier exists in the codebase.** Tiers today: anonymous / signed-in / BYO-key.
- **The free path is not open-weight today**: Lite's default primary is Gemini 2.5 Flash
  Lite (proprietary, via OpenRouter). This is one env var, but it is a policy gap against
  the "free = open models" requirement.

## 2. Workload classification (by capability, not UI)

### A. Lightweight structured assistance
Choose a chassis/category, suggest fields and labels, recommend animation presets, produce
a small validated design spec, explain a validation error, repair a known-code failure.
Today: W3/W7 (built), the unsupported-decision explanations, the Lite server repair.
**Verdict: the Lite pattern is exactly right** - one small structured call, enum-constrained
schema, deterministic compile, server-owned route. New A-tasks become new *task profiles*
on the generalized Lite infrastructure (section 4), not extensions of the lower-third
prompt. Free tier, open-model allowlist.

### B. Multimodal graphic analysis
Analyze an imported raster graphic: type, text regions, field roles, typography class,
nearest bundled font, colors, safe margins, logo regions, animation suggestion.
Today: **does not exist**. The Lite harness cannot serve it: text-only by deliberate
policy (`limits.logos = 0`), 32 KB body cap, catalog-grounded prompt, lower-third-only
schema. **Verdict: a separate versioned `imported-graphic-analysis` harness** on the same
gateway/policy/ledger, with a vision-capable open model. Proposal-only output (section 6).
Free tier (quota'd), open-model allowlist.

### C. Code or template generation
The SPX custom coder (W1 custom arm, W5, W8, W10) and both video coders (V1/V2); state
machine and timeline logic ride inside those emits. **Verdict: keep as the two existing
code harnesses; extract the duplicated repair-loop/validator/prompt-scaffold seam into
shared infrastructure** (section 5). These are 16k-token outputs with multi-round repair -
too expensive for the free quota'd tier at launch. They stay BYO-key / (future) paid, with
open coding models (Qwen3-coder family is already Lite's fallback) as benchmark candidates
for a later free code-repair task profile.

### D. High-cost creative generation
Three alternatives x repair, polish, full video generation, long-context iterative repair.
**Verdict: BYO-key or paid-only workflows on the same gateway.** Never on the free
open-model quota at launch; a benchmark may later promote individual D-tasks (e.g. one
grounded alternative) into A-shaped profiles.

Per-category answer to the Phase 2 question:

| Category | Lite harness unchanged | Extended Lite infra | Separate harness, shared infra | Specialist model | Paid-only |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | lower-third creation: yes | yes (new task profiles) | - | small text model | no |
| B | no | policy/ledger only | **yes** | open VLM | no |
| C | no | policy/ledger later | yes (existing SPX/video coders) | coding model | mostly (BYO now) |
| D | no | no | existing | strong model | yes |

---

## 3. NoaCG Lite: evaluation and verdict

**What Lite is today** (all four at once, verified): a *product tier* (free, signed-in,
quota'd), a *pipeline restriction* (catalog-only structured spec, no code paths, typed
`LiteRequestError` on every disallowed op), a *server-owned model policy* (routes, prices,
ZDR, prompt version - config, not code), and a *prompt contract* (6 audited chassis,
semantic line roles, versioned `lite-lower-third-v3`). It is **not a separate harness**:
a ready decision rejoins the identical `groundedResult` / `lite/pipeline.ts` compile path
the main harness uses, pinned by `ai-lite-bench.test.mjs`.

- Input/output contracts: `LiteGenerationRequest` -> `LiteDecision` (versioned by prompt
  id + `LiteGenerationSpec.version: 1`). Text-only, deliberately.
- Optimized for catalog-grounded creation: yes, aggressively (650-token curated digest vs
  the main harness's 12k-token full digest; semantic role validation; contrast checks).
- Can it serve editor assistance and image analysis? Editor assistance of A-shape: yes,
  as sibling task profiles. Image analysis: no - every design decision in it (no images,
  tiny body, enum-locked schema, lower-third semantics) points the other way. Extending
  the Lite prompt/schema to carry vision would produce exactly the oversized universal
  harness the constraints forbid, and would put the multimodal privacy surface inside the
  most privacy-sensitive free path.
- What extending would cost: the semantic validator, the unsupported screen, and the
  benchmark suites are all lower-third-specific; each new capability grafted onto them
  multiplies the versioning surface of one prompt instead of adding an independent one.

**Verdict: CONFIRM the proposed architecture.** Keep NoaCG Lite as the lightweight
catalog-grounded creation harness, unchanged in scope. Generalize its *infrastructure*
(profile, allowlist, quota ledger, rate limit, ZDR policy, outcome telemetry, benchmark
pattern) into a shared task layer that new focused harnesses plug into. Components shared
even when harnesses are separate: the gateway adapters, schema revalidation, the policy/
budget/ledger layer, the compile/validation pipeline (`lite/pipeline`, `validateTemplate`,
`runtimeBench`, safety screen), the repair-loop seam, and the bench calibration pattern.

```

Layer notes (all generalizations of code that exists):

1. **AI task registry** (`api/_lib/aiTaskRegistry.ts`, NEW): a typed map
   `taskId -> TaskProfile`. `TaskProfile` is `LiteProfile` generalized: schema refs +
   versions, allowed tiers (`anonymous | free | byo | paid`), token/image/resolution
   limits, timeout/retry, `routePolicy`, ledger kind. Browser mirror exposes only what
   `/api/ai/lite/status` exposes today: availability, limits, allowance - never routes.
2. **Shared model gateway**: unchanged (`aiGateway.ts`). Free-tier tasks route only
   through catalog-approved entries and fail closed (`profile_not_configured`) rather than
   fall back to an unapproved route - the exact fail-closed pattern
   `liteProfileConfigured()` has. Per the ratified section-15 decision, `openWeights` is
   catalog metadata the benchmark-first promotion policy reads (prefer open at parity),
   not a hard per-request gate.
3. **Task harnesses**: Lite design-spec (exists), imported-graphic-analysis (new,
   section 6), SPX coder (exists), repair (exists inside both coders; extract the seam),
   video (exists). Each owns its prompt + schema + version; none owns routes or quotas.
4. **Canonical structured contracts**: every task schema carries an explicit version
   (Lite's prompt-version pattern + `GenerationSpec`'s `version: 1` pattern); server
   revalidation already exists; add per-task deterministic normalizers (Lite's
   `normalizeLiteSpec` is the template) and stable error codes (Lite's taxonomy).
5. **Policy and budget**: `aiLiteProfile` + `aiLiteStore` + `aiLiteRateLimit`
   parameterized by task id. Reservation-then-reconcile cost accounting stays.
6. **Observability**: extend `ai_generations` with a `task` column (migration; additive)
   and route the currently-unobserved paths through it where a managed key is used.
   Keep the content-free rule absolute.

**Not** one universal prompt; **not** a second scene model; provider selection stays in
config; product features reference task ids only.

## 5. Harness boundaries and shared seams

Keep four harnesses: **lite-design-spec**, **imported-graphic-analysis**,
**spx-coder** (generate/modify/convert/fix), **video** (director+coder per engine).
Extract into `src/ai/shared/` (browser) without changing behavior:

- the bounded repair loop (`MAX_REPAIR_ROUNDS`, re-validate each round, exact-findings
  feedback, soft-finding demotion) - today duplicated in `claudeProvider.ts` and
  `claudeVideoProvider.ts`;
- the injected-validator seam (unify `SpxValidator` / `VideoValidator` shapes);
- the forced-tool prompt scaffold (contract + principles + one canonical example);
- telemetry (`startAiRun`) - wire the video harness in (it records nothing today);
- the safety screen policy - the SPX regex screen where code runs same-origin; the video
  side keeps its structural sandbox but gains the same telemetry hooks.

Inside video, collapse the two FORBIDDEN tables, the duplicated example design, and the
two dead-control checks behind the existing `emitConfig(engine)` seam.
The W10 gap is closed (2026-07-28): `AIPromptPanel` injects the same
`productionSpxValidator` composition `AiStep` uses (bench + safety in the repair loop),
and its Anthropic-only copy is updated.

## 6. Import Graphic AI assistant (design)

The manual flow stays untouched and complete (`docs/IMPORT_MVP.md`). AI is one optional,
proposal-only action.

### 6.1 UX flow

1. **Entry**: after artwork lands (Design step) and on the Prepare/Text steps, one button:
   **"Analyze graphic with AI"**, with the standing disclosure line and a first-use consent
   notice (section 9). Invisible/disabled in offline builds and when signed out (same
   `needsSignIn` pattern as Lite); the manual path never regresses.
2. **Run**: the artwork is downscaled client-side for analysis (at most 1920x1080, per
   the ratified section-15 quota decision; JPEG/PNG re-encode; the original is never
   uploaded at full size), sent with optional user instructions to
   `POST /api/ai/tasks/imported-graphic-analysis`.
3. **Proposal review**: a panel lists suggestions grouped (type, text regions, fonts,
   colors, logo/image regions, animation), each with a confidence badge and a checkbox;
   region suggestions draw as outlined overlays on the placement canvas. Warnings render
   verbatim. Buttons: **Apply selected**, **Apply all**, **Dismiss**,
   **Re-run with instructions** (a one-line text input, counts against quota).
4. **Apply**: accepted suggestions become a single `DraftPatch` - `designFields:
   DesignFieldSpec[]` (normalized coords converted to design px), per-field `fontId`/
   `fontSize`/`weight`/`color`/`align`/`lineHeight`/`letterSpacing`, draft-level `fontId`,
   and `animation` (preset/direction/easing/speed from the four `DESIGN_PRESETS`). The
   template is rebuilt by `buildDraftTemplate` -> `addPlacedLine` / `setLineTextStyle` /
   `setLineFit` - the same canonical transforms manual placement uses. **No new
   representation of fields, layers, animations, or states is created.**
5. **Undo / reject**: at wizard time a dismissed or replaced proposal is just a draft
   patch away (manual edits keep working on the same `designFields`). If the action is
   ever offered post-create, all accepted suggestions compose into ONE template and apply
   via a single `applyTemplate(next)` - one undo step through the store choke point.
6. **Outcome telemetry**: accepted / partially-accepted / dismissed (+ enumerated reason)
   posts to the outcome endpoint, content-free - the Lite outcome pattern.

### 6.2 Structured contract (`imported-graphic-analysis` v1)

```ts
// src/ai/importAnalysis/contract.ts (browser) + served by the task endpoint
interface ImportedGraphicAnalysisV1 {
  version: 1;
  graphicType: 'lower-third' | 'title-card' | 'scoreboard' | 'info-graphic'
    | 'quote-card' | 'name-strap' | 'other';
  graphicTypeConfidence: number;            // 0..1
  canvas: { aspect: number };               // echo, sanity check
  regions: Array<{
    kind: 'text' | 'logo' | 'image' | 'decorative';
    bbox: { x: number; y: number; w: number; h: number };  // normalized 0..1
    confidence: number;
    // text regions only:
    role?: 'person-name' | 'person-role' | 'organization' | 'team-name'
      | 'story-headline' | 'event-name' | 'location' | 'score' | 'time'
      | 'supporting-context' | 'other';
    suggestedTitle?: string;                // operator-facing field label
    sampleText?: string;                    // transcription of visible text
    align?: 'left' | 'center' | 'right';
    typography?: {
      classification: 'serif' | 'sans' | 'slab' | 'condensed' | 'mono'
        | 'display' | 'script';
      matchQuality: 'similar-available' | 'general-classification';
        // NEVER 'exact' from a raster - see 6.3
      suggestedFontId: 'inter' | 'space-grotesk' | 'jetbrains-mono' | 'manrope'
        | 'archivo' | 'oswald' | 'bebas-neue' | null;   // enum = the 7 bundled fonts
      approxWeight?: 300 | 400 | 500 | 600 | 700 | 800 | 900;
      fontSizeNorm?: number;                // cap height / canvas height
      letterSpacing?: 'tight' | 'normal' | 'wide';
      lineHeightRatio?: number;
      color?: string;                       // #rrggbb
    };
  }>;                                        // maxItems bounded (e.g. 12)
  safeMargins?: { top: number; right: number; bottom: number; left: number }; // normalized
  animation?: {
    presetId: 'design-fade' | 'design-slide' | 'design-pop' | 'design-blur';
    direction: 'both' | 'in' | 'out';
    easing?: string; speed?: 0.75 | 1 | 1.5;
  };
  warnings: string[];                        // uncertainty, verbatim to the user
}
```

Deterministic normalization clamps bboxes to 0..1, drops regions below a confidence
floor, converts normalized coords to design px against `DesignArt.width/height`, snaps
`approxWeight` into the target font's real `weights` range, and validates `suggestedFontId`
against `FONTS`. Server revalidates against the schema exactly as every task already is.

### 6.3 The font-honesty rule

Exact font identification from a raster is not claimable and the schema makes the claim
inexpressible: `matchQuality` has no `exact` member, `suggestedFontId` is enum-locked to
the seven bundled fonts (mapped via their `styleTags` facet), and the prompt instructs the
model to classify, transcribe, and pick the *nearest available* face with a confidence
score. "Probable match to a known commercial font" may appear only inside `warnings` as
prose, clearly labelled unverified.

## 7. Open-model gateway, allowlist, and routing

- **Allowlist** (`api/_lib/aiModelCatalog.ts`, NEW, server-only): entries
  `{ route, openWeights: boolean, capabilities: {vision, coding, structuredOutput,
  contextWindow}, price, zdrAvailable, notes }`. Free-tier task profiles may only
  reference catalog-approved entries; the registry fails closed otherwise. Per the
  ratified section-15 decision, `openWeights` drives the benchmark-first promotion
  preference (open wins at parity; a superior proprietary model is never excluded for
  closed weights alone) rather than acting as a hard gate. The browser never sees this
  file's content.
- **Routing is capability-based per task**, configured not coded: A-tasks -> small text
  model; B-tasks -> open VLM; C-tasks -> coding model; a stronger *allowlisted* fallback
  only after validation failure (the Lite primary/fallback + 2-attempt ceiling pattern,
  unchanged). Paid/BYO routes only for explicitly paid features; free tasks never
  silently reach a proprietary route.
- **Candidate pool** (recommendation, to be verified by the benchmark and current
  OpenRouter listings, never hardcoded into product logic): text/structured - Qwen3
  small instruct, Mistral Small (both already in Lite's price table), Llama 3.3/4 small;
  vision - Qwen VL family, Gemma 3 27B, Llama 4 multimodal, InternVL, Mistral Small
  multimodal; coding - Qwen3-coder (already Lite's fallback), DeepSeek coder family.
  Hugging Face serves as the discovery/metadata/license source feeding the allowlist,
  and optionally as an inference provider through a future `ProviderAdapter` - never a
  direct dependency of product code.
- **Lite's primary under the ratified policy**: the current default (Gemini 2.5 Flash
  Lite, proprietary) stands until the bench runs; it is replaced by an open-weight model
  only if one matches or beats it on NoaCG's benchmarks (env change + bench run, no code
  change). Section 15, decision 1.

### 7a. The spend policy for harness work (owner, 2026-08-09)

The product rule and the bench rule are the same rule, and both are enforced in code rather
than remembered:

- **Everything runs on the Vercel AI Gateway, on open-weight or otherwise cheap models.**
  `FUNDED_ROUTE_PROVIDER = 'vercel'` and `FUNDED_ROUTE_PRICE_CEILING` (1.00 in / 5.00 out per
  million) gate anything NoaCG funds; an uncatalogued route fails closed. OpenAI and Anthropic
  as DIRECT providers are reachable only through a user's own sealed key - never funded. The
  same model served through the gateway is an ordinary `vercel` route: the distinction is who
  holds the credential, not who made the model.
- **A frontier route in a bench needs a stated reason.** `scripts/harness-route-policy.mjs`
  refuses a non-gateway route unless `--frontier-reason="…"` is given, and writes the reason
  into the round's results. The standing legitimate case is comparing NoaCG Pro against a
  frontier model. This project has no revenue; the failure mode is the habit, not the one
  deliberate comparison.
  Gated: `pro-spike`, `creative-route-bench`, `creative-pilot-bench` (all three - its arms can
  run on different models), `pro-machine-probe`, and `ai-bench-compare` (on the route RESOLVED
  from the app's settings, since it names only a model). `pro-bench` and `pro-interpret-probe`
  were on this list until 2026-08-15, when the engine they drove was deleted. Not gated, by design rather than omission: `ai-vision-run`, `ai-lite-compare` and
  `ai-lite-spike` cannot express a non-gateway route at all - the module's header says why.
- **Image output is the unmeasured surface.** Concept images bill through output tokens and no
  per-run product ceiling has been set (§9, `docs/ADMIN.md` §9). The bench's `--max-cost`
  ceiling counts both calls and is the only guard today.
- **Vocabulary.** *Harness* = the code wrapping a model (prompt, schema, repair, validation).
  *Tier* = what the customer gets (Lite / Pro / BYO). *Bench* or *eval* = the rig that measures
  a harness. "Improve the harness" and "run a bench" are different work.

## 8. Benchmark design

Extend the existing `ai-lite-bench` machinery (fixtures, holdout, gold/floor calibration,
manifest identity, blind gallery, taxonomy, hard cost caps) rather than building anew.

- **Lite structured suite**: exists (`lite-spec-v1`). Add fixtures for long names (partly
  present in the holdout), CJK and RTL scripts, contrast-hostile custom palettes, and
  sparse briefs. Run the deferred discovery funnel (`bench:discover/qualify/confirm/
  compare`) with open-weight candidates plus the incumbent proprietary baseline, and
  promote per the benchmark-first policy (section 15, decision 1).
- **Vision suite** (`import-analysis-v1`, NEW): a hand-labelled dataset of 40-60 images -
  lower thirds, name straps, full-screen infographics, scoreboards, title cards, quote
  cards, logo-bearing, light/dark, transparent/flattened, odd aspect ratios, multi-region,
  no-editable-text, hostile typography. Ground truth: type, region bboxes, roles, font
  classification, nearest bundled font, colors. Metrics: type accuracy, region precision/
  recall, bbox IoU, role accuracy, font-class accuracy, bundled-font pick quality, color
  delta, schema success rate, hallucination rate (regions where none exist; the
  no-editable-text images are the tripwire), simulated user-edit effort (fields needing
  correction), latency, cost. Public dev cases separate from a hidden holdout, exactly as
  Lite does. Gold ceiling = hand-authored proposals; floor = seeded random valid output.
- **Code/template suite**: reuse `ai-compare.mjs` / `ai-bench.mjs` / `video-bench.mjs`
  arms with open coding models as additional candidates; metrics already exist (build
  success, runtime validity, bench findings, repair success, overlap/readability,
  determinism via pipeline identity). Fold `bench:sameness` (now on main) into the
  vision and code scorecards where captures exist.
- Per-model scorecards per suite; different winners per category are expected and fine.
  Promotion follows `docs/AI_LITE_PROMOTION.md` once its owner thresholds are set.

## 9. Privacy, consent, quota, and cost controls

- **Disclosure (owner update, 2026-08-10)**: Create with AI is covered by public Terms and
  Privacy pages, linked from an explicit account-creation acknowledgement. It does not show
  the old interruptive first-use dialog and does not substitute another warning surface.
  Managed requests still disclose that the request passes through Vercel AI Gateway to an
  eligible model provider for transient processing, under required zero-retention and
  no-training flags. Other AI surfaces retain their existing notice until deliberately
  migrated; the versioned acceptance record remains for them.
- **Data minimization**: analysis images downscaled/cropped client-side; only the
  relevant catalog subset/schema context sent per task (Lite's 650-token digest is the
  model); no project data beyond the task inputs; ledger stays content-free.
- **ZDR**: the Lite OpenRouter policy (`zdr`, `data_collection:'deny'`, endpoint
  allowlist, price ceilings) becomes the default for every free task route; fail closed.
- **Quota/cost**: per-task profiles reuse the reservation ledger - daily/monthly starts
  and successes, per-user + fleet concurrency, per-call cost ceiling, daily fleet spend,
  IP burst gate. Vision tasks add max images (1) and max resolution to the profile.
- **Hardening `/api/ai/generate`** (managed-key path): add a modest rate limit and a
  ledger row (task `'byo-generate'`, content-free). BYO-key traffic spends the user's own
  key but still gets the rate limit. The credentials endpoint's missing sign-in
  requirement is decided (section 15, decision 4): hosted requires sign-in; self-host
  keeps account-free BYO keys behind an explicit flag, off by default.
- AI stays optional everywhere a manual workflow exists (import stays manual-first;
  "Open as code (no AI)" stays one click).

## 10. Migration plan (preserve everything that works)

1. Additive only: the task registry mounts beside the existing endpoints;
   `/api/ai/lite/*` keeps working unchanged (Lite becomes task id `lite-design-spec`
   internally; public URLs unchanged until a major cleanup).
2. `ai_generations` gains a nullable `task` column (additive migration, no backfill).
3. Browser: `lite/client.ts` patterns generalize into a small `taskClient.ts`; Lite's
   client keeps its API.
4. Shared-seam extraction (repair loop, validator seam, telemetry) is behavior-neutral
   refactoring, each step proven by `ai-compare.mjs` regression mode + the free Lite
   regression suite (`bench:regress` pipeline-identity hashes).
5. Provider-specific paths: none need removing - Anthropic/OpenAI stay for BYO and future
   paid routes; the model catalog constrains only free-tier task profiles, with the
   benchmark-first open-weight preference applied at promotion time.
6. W10 fix and stale-copy cleanup land independently of the platform work.

## 11. Testing strategy

- **Build gate** (free): extend `run-ai-gateway-tests.mjs` with registry tests (schema
  validation, tier gating, fail-closed allowlist, quota math); `ai-lite-bench.test.mjs`
  pattern pins "one compile path" for the analysis normalizer too.
- **E2E** (offline, stub-backed): an `import-analysis.spec.ts` driving the proposal panel
  with the stub provider (the `ai-more-control.spec.ts` pattern) - propose, partial
  accept, re-run, dismiss, manual-path-unaffected, offline build shows no AI UI
  (`e2e/auth.spec.ts` doctrine).
- **Paid benches** (never CI): the vision suite runner with hard call/cost caps; Lite
  discovery funnel; `ai-compare.mjs` for any repair-seam refactor.
- **Mutation-test the guards** (repo doctrine): a spec asserting "no AI call happened"
  must fail when the guard is removed.

## 12. Rollout stages

1. **Stage 0 - hygiene** (no product change): W10 validator fix, stale copy, dead-code
   removals, `/api/ai/generate` rate limit + ledger row.
2. **Stage 1 - platform**: task registry + model catalog/allowlist + generalized policy
   layer; Lite re-expressed as the first task profile (behavior-identical, proven by
   `bench:regress`).
3. **Stage 2 - disclosure**: public Terms and Privacy plus the account-creation
   acknowledgement for Create with AI; retain notice recording only on surfaces that still
   mount it; ZDR-by-default for free routes; run the Lite bench and settle the primary per the
   benchmark-first policy.
4. **Stage 3 - Import analysis**: harness + proposal UI behind a server flag
   (`AI_TASK_IMPORT_ANALYSIS_ENABLED`, default off), stub-first e2e, then the vision
   benchmark (>=3 open VLMs) picks the launch route; enable for override users, then free.
5. **Stage 4 - consolidation**: shared repair-loop seam, video telemetry, video-internal
   dedup; open-model candidates added to the code benches.

## 13. Risks and unresolved questions

- **Open VLM quality on broadcast graphics is unproven** - the benchmark is the gate; the
  feature ships proposal-only precisely so a mediocre model wastes a click, not a graphic.
- **Bbox precision** may be the weakest VLM skill; mitigation: normalized coords + snapping
  to detected ink (`RegionInk` from the erase pass can cross-check text regions
  deterministically - a genuinely nice fusion the manual pipeline already computes).
- **Cost drift on OpenRouter open-model endpoints** - price ceilings + fail-closed pricing
  already handle this; keep them mandatory for every free route.
- **Registry over-engineering** - keep `TaskProfile` a literal generalization of
  `LiteProfile`; resist adding capability negotiation until a third harness needs it.
- **Consent UX friction** vs legal safety - one-time notice per account, not per call.
- Open: where does the analysis button live exactly (Design vs Prepare vs Text step);
  should post-create re-analysis exist at v1 (recommend: no); when do paid tiers exist at
  all (out of scope here).

## 15. First implementation slice and owner decisions

**First slice** (matches the suggested sensible slice):
1. Land this audit/plan for review (this document).
2. Introduce `aiTaskRegistry` + `aiModelCatalog` (the approved-route catalog with
   `openWeights` metadata), re-express Lite as the first task profile with `bench:regress`
   proving byte-identical behavior.
3. Ship the consent/disclosure notice (gates everything free).
4. Build the `imported-graphic-analysis` harness v1 + proposal-only UI behind its flag,
   applying only through `DraftPatch`/`addPlacedLine`.
5. Benchmark >=3 vision-capable open models on the labelled dataset; pick the launch route
   by scorecard; enable for override users.

**Owner decisions — RATIFIED 2026-07-28** (these supersede the corresponding proposals in
sections 6, 7, and 9 above; `docs/GOALS_ARCHIVE.md` carries the same wording):

1. **Model policy: benchmark-first with an open-weight preference, not a hard mandate.**
   An open-weight model is used whenever it performs as well as or better than the
   proprietary alternatives on NoaCG's own benchmarks; a superior proprietary model is
   never excluded merely for closed weights. Route selection remains explicit server
   configuration - never a silent fallback - so section 7's `openWeightsOnly` fail-closed
   flag becomes a *preference rule applied at benchmark promotion time*, and the model
   catalog keeps `openWeights` as metadata the promotion policy reads, not a hard gate.
2. **Consent notice**: prompts and uploaded images may be sent to an external AI provider;
   users must not upload sensitive or confidential material; NoaCG prefers ZDR-capable
   routes where available but cannot guarantee identical retention across providers.
   Acceptance is stored server-side for signed-in users (timestamp + notice version) and
   client-side for anonymous users, with renewed acceptance when the version changes.
3. **Free Import Graphic vision quota**: 1 image per analysis, 10 successful analyses per
   day, 100 per month; images downscaled to at most 1920x1080 before sending (supersedes
   section 6.1's 1280 px suggestion). Only successes count against the quota; abuse-oriented
   rate limiting is separate; actual per-run provider costs are recorded so the numbers can
   be tuned from real usage.
4. **BYO credentials require sign-in on the hosted service**, associating keys with the
   user rather than a browser cookie. Account-free BYO-key use survives for private
   self-hosted installs behind an explicit configuration flag, disabled by default in the
   hosted product.
5. **Who pays decides the route.** NoaCG Lite and every other free hosted surface are paid
   for by the project, not the user, and there is no revenue yet - so a route NoaCG pays for
   must be a **cheap model on the managed transport**, which since 2026-08-07 is Vercel AI
   Gateway rather than OpenRouter. The DIRECT OpenAI and Anthropic APIs are reachable **only
   through the user's own sealed key** (decision 4); no managed NoaCG key is wired into a
   hosted path for them. Note what that does and does not forbid: an Anthropic or OpenAI model
   served *through the gateway* is an ordinary `vercel` route and perfectly fundable if it is
   cheap - the constraint is about who holds the credential, not who made the model. This is a
   cost constraint, not a quality judgement: it composes with decision 1 rather than replacing
   it - benchmark whatever is worth benchmarking, but a candidate cannot be promoted to a
   NoaCG-funded route unless it is cheap and reachable through the managed gateway adapter.
   Revisit when there is income.

## 16. Open owner decisions (raised 2026-07-31, harness routing + evaluation work)

Implemented in that change: honest routing already shipped, so this added the **kind**
half of brief satisfaction (`templates/structuralAnchor.ts` +
`validation/structuralIntentCheck.ts` `structuralKindFindings`), ran the satisfaction check
on the **grounded** path where the wrong-graphic defect actually happens, and added the free
**benchmark preflight** (`npm run bench:preflight`). Nothing below was decided unilaterally.

1. **Re-run the import-analysis vision round?** RULED 2026-07-31: **not yet.** The 2026-07-29
   run was not a valid comparison, and one of its stated causes is now fixed: the per-axis
   size cap rejected every portrait case. The cap is now a pixel budget plus a longest-edge
   ceiling (`IMPORT_ANALYSIS_LIMITS.maxPixels` / `maxEdge`), so portrait artwork is admitted
   at the same budget as landscape instead of being squeezed onto the short axis - which also
   returns roughly 3x the pixels to a task whose whole job is reading small text.
   The other stated causes were NOT addressed and are not addressable for free: two
   candidates failed all 35 images for reasons never isolated, and the best region precision
   was 23% against a gold ceiling of 100%. **Before any re-run**: the task's separate model
   profile gets the same dry-run/preflight protection the Lite benches have, and the two
   open questions above are investigated first. Paid vision candidates are NOT re-added to
   the catalog merely to repeat the old experiment; if a re-run is eventually approved, the
   candidates enter in the SAME change as the run that justifies them
   (`api/_lib/aiModelCatalog.ts`).

   **Both preconditions are now met (2026-07-31).** The preflight:
   `npm run bench:preflight -- --task=import-analysis <models>` resolves every arm through
   the real `importAnalysisProfile` + task registry (route approval, pricing, allowlist,
   kill switch, attribution, arm distinctness - free, no network), and `ai-vision-run.mjs`
   runs the same preflight with each candidate's RESOLVED allowlist injected before any
   call is paid for; its no-`--confirm-spend` dry run now includes it.

   **Investigation of the two all-35 failures (free evidence only):**
   - The per-row error codes and predictions were written only to `vision-bench-out/` in a
     since-deleted worktree; nothing was committed, so the uniform failures can no longer
     be READ - only re-produced. (Lesson: a paid run's scorecards are part of the result;
     keep them with the change that reports them.)
   - The withdrawal commit (30d9946) narrows the suspects: llama-4-scout produced
     predictions (it hallucinated regions on no-text art), so the two all-35 failures were
     among gemini-2.5-flash, mistral-small-2603, gemma-3-12b-it and qwen3.5-9b.
   - OpenRouter metadata TODAY shows both withdrawn models with multiple structured-output
     endpoints inside their audited prices, so "no structured-output endpoint" was not the
     mechanism. What free metadata CANNOT establish is ZDR/data-policy eligibility - the
     profile requires `zdr` + `dataCollection: 'deny'` + `allowProviderFallbacks: false`,
     and a candidate with zero ZDR-eligible endpoints fails every call identically. A
     second candidate mechanism: qwen3.5-9b's endpoints expose `reasoning`, and a
     reasoning-by-default model can burn the task's 2000-token output cap before emitting
     the structured answer - also uniform across images.
   - The two remaining hypotheses are only distinguishable by a paid call, so the re-run
     protocol when approved: `--limit=2` per candidate FIRST (~cents), read the per-row
     error codes (kept beside predictions since 99af44e), then decide the full pass.
   - Region precision (23% best vs a 100% gold ceiling, 0% floor): with the predictions
     gone this cannot be decomposed retrospectively. The instrumentation for next time
     exists (predictions beside scores, `--limit` diagnosis, the pixel-budget fix restoring
     ~3x pixels to portrait text); whether cheap VLMs can place boxes at all remains the
     open product question - plan §6's no-coordinates lesson already assumes they cannot.

2. **Does the pixel-budget cap need re-ratifying?** RULED 2026-07-31: recorded as an
   **AMENDMENT to ratified decision 3**. Decision 3's "downscaled to at most 1920x1080" now
   reads: downscaled to at most the 1920x1080 PIXEL BUDGET (`maxPixels` = 2,073,600) with a
   1920px longest-edge ceiling (`maxEdge`), orientation-free. What leaves the machine and
   what the call costs both scale with pixel count, not orientation, so the bound is
   unchanged in substance; portrait artwork simply stops being squeezed onto its short axis.
   Implemented in `src/ai/importAnalysis/contract.ts` (`IMPORT_ANALYSIS_LIMITS`) and
   enforced client-side before anything leaves the machine (`client.ts`).

3. **Should a kind mismatch be an ERROR rather than a warning?** RULED 2026-07-31: **an
   error.** A structurally wrong-kind grounded result - a technically valid lower third for
   a stinger brief - must not be delivered as a success. Implemented: kind findings carry
   their own rule (`structural-kind`, `src/model/structuralIntent.ts`) and the provider
   lands them as blocking ERRORS on grounded results (an honest failure the user refines or
   regenerates); parts findings stay `structural-intent` warnings. Grounded assemblies have
   no repair loop, so nothing about the frozen control's repair behaviour changes; the
   custom path is never kind-checked (its spec's variantId names a chassis that was never
   assembled). Regression: e2e/creative-routing.spec.ts drives the real provider with the
   gateway intercepted and pins both directions.

4. **Model promotion remains untouched.** No default model changed and none is proposed:
   the machine scores anti-correlated with human satisfaction, so they do not support a
   promotion. `docs/AI_LITE_PROMOTION.md` still governs, and its thresholds are still
   owner-TODO.
