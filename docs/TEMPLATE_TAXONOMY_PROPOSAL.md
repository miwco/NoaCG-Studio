# Template taxonomy & discovery - proposal

**Status: ADOPTED & IMPLEMENTED** (all six §18 recommended decisions accepted; §17 stages 1-5
shipped on this branch - facet registries in `src/model/taxonomy.ts`, declared meta in
`src/templates/meta.ts`, derivation in `src/templates/templateMeta.ts`, the browse engine in
`src/templates/search.ts`, the wizard's Browse step in
`src/components/wizard/steps/BrowseStep.tsx`, factory assertions live. Still open from stage
6: the pack "kit" surface, the community/nightly publish contract, zero-result telemetry, and
the §18 open questions.) The sections below are kept as the design record.

**Original status: PROPOSAL - not implemented, not binding.** This document is the reviewable deliverable
for the "Start from template" faceted-discovery redesign. Nothing here renames existing
categories, changes code, or alters the catalog until the proposal is approved. Source of truth
for the domain: `live_format_graphics_needs.xlsx` (repo root, untracked - 60 formats, sheet
"Live Format Graphics"). Companion existing docs: `PACK_TAXONOMY.md`, `GRAPHIC_TYPES.md`,
`DESIGN_LANGUAGE.md`.

## 0. Summary

The workbook's 60 formats ask for ~470 distinct graphic phrasings, which normalize into **26
functional graphic categories**. The current wizard browses 11 category tiles with 3 ephemeral
filter chips and no search. The proposal:

- **Eight independent facets**: programme format, graphic category, structure, editable fields,
  capabilities, placement, visual style, motion. Facets combine like a storefront filter;
  programme format ranks rather than excludes.
- **Derive, don't duplicate.** Most facet values are computed from what the codebase already
  declares (types, packs, field schemas, machines, presets, zones). Only four things are newly
  declared per template: primary category, subtype, structure list, and field semantics.
  Hand-written duplication of derivable facts is the failure mode this design refuses.
- **One Browse step replaces Category + Template**: search bar, category tiles with counts,
  progressive "More filters", live result grid, existing preview pane untouched.
- The existing **12 packs stay** as the curated "kit" layer; the 60 formats become the
  programme-format facet, grouped under **12 programme families**.

What separates this document's claims:
- **[FACT]** - confirmed from the workbook or current code.
- **[PROPOSAL]** - a product decision recommended here, open to review.
- **[OPEN]** - a genuine unresolved question, listed in §18.

---

## 1. Confirmed facts (audit results)

### 1.1 The workbook [FACT]

- Sheet 1 "Live Format Graphics": 60 rows, two columns (`Format / genre`,
  `Graphics typically needed`). Sheet 2 "Notes": created 2026-07-08, rankings intentionally
  removed - so **no popularity data exists**; any "popular" sort would be fabricated.
- Splitting column B on `;` yields **469 distinct raw terms** after case/punctuation
  normalization. Highest-frequency raw terms: social handles (11), countdown (11), sponsor bug
  (9), ticker (7), topic cards (7), host/guest lower thirds (7), timer (7), speaker lower
  thirds (6), poll results (5), agenda (5), social hashtag (5).
- Counting by concept rather than raw string (the `GRAPHIC_TYPES.md` §6 method): lower third 52,
  sponsor bug 37, countdown 30, topic card 29, title card 23, agenda 22, social handle 17,
  poll 13, holding screen 9, ticker 8, scoreboard 5.

### 1.2 The current system [FACT]

- **Catalog**: `TemplateCategory` (12 ids, 11 browsable) in `src/model/wizard.ts`; 79 variants
  (48 type-compiled designs + imp01 + ~30 unclaimed hand-written).
  `TemplateVariant` metadata today: `id`, `typeId?`, `category`, `name`, `styleTag`,
  `description`, `maxLines`, `suggestedLines`, `logo`, `animationPresets`, `defaultPalette`,
  `defaultFontId`, `defaultZone`. **No tags, no pack pointer, no search index.**
- **Types**: 12 `GraphicType`s (`src/templates/types/registry.ts`) declaring structure, fields
  (with `role: line|data|hidden|logo`), machine, controls, capabilities, designs. The
  type × family matrix is full (48 cells).
- **Packs**: 12 `TemplatePack`s (`src/templates/packs.ts`) - curated type subsets with a default
  family; **every one of the 60 workbook formats maps to exactly one pack**, validated by
  `scripts/factory.mjs`. Packs have no wizard surface yet.
- **Style**: exactly one style axis, `StyleTag = minimal | sport | glass | noacg`, carried on
  variants, palettes, fonts, packs. Shape tokens per family in `src/model/themeTokens.ts`.
- **Motion**: 31 `AnimPresetId`s + 12 easing presets (`src/model/easings.ts`, tagged
  standard/playful/continuous). No intensity metadata.
- **Fields**: `FieldKind = text | lines | number | color | select | toggle | image`;
  `FieldDescriptor` is the one shared render contract. Field ids are positional `f0..fN`;
  types name fields logically and compile them.
- **Placement**: `Zone9` nine anchor zones, safe-area snapped by construction.
- **Wizard discovery today**: Category tiles (name + description + count), Template card grid
  with `MiniPreview` stills, three ephemeral filter chips (style family, logo, 3+ lines),
  no search, no sort control, filters reset on re-entry.
- **Gap list** (`PACK_TAXONOMY.md`): goal/progress bar, charts/maps, chat/alert overlays,
  frames, QR code, reveal moments, lineups/brackets/leaderboards, lyrics/captions,
  replay wipes/stingers - workbook asks, no type covers.

### 1.3 What the audit changes about the brief

The master brief assumes taxonomy must be built from scratch. It doesn't: **the programme-format
half already exists as machine-validated config** (packs), and the graphic-purpose half is
two-thirds built (types with measured frequencies). The real gaps are (a) a normalized
category list wider than the 12 wizard categories, (b) per-template facet metadata beyond
`styleTag`/`maxLines`/`logo`, (c) search, and (d) the browse UX.

---

## 2. The facet model - one principle

**A facet value is derived from an existing canonical source wherever one exists; it is
declared only where no source exists.** This is the same rule the state-machine model uses
("persist a machine only when the derived one is wrong") and it is what keeps 79 templates'
metadata from rotting.

| Facet | Source | Derived or declared |
|---|---|---|
| A. Programme formats | pack membership of the template's graphic category's types (+ extras by id) | **derived** (overridable) |
| B. Graphic category | new declaration (primary + optional extras + subtype) | **declared** |
| C. Structure | new declaration (small controlled list) | **declared** |
| D. Editable fields | compiled field schema (`SpxField[]` → `FieldDescriptor[]`) | **derived**; semantics declared |
| E. Capabilities | machine + type + preset + field schema | **derived**; a few declared extras |
| F. Placement | `defaultZone` + category coverage class | **derived** |
| G. Visual style | `styleTag` | **derived** (exists) |
| H. Motion | `animationPresets` + a new per-preset intensity table | **derived** |

Everything derived is computed once at registry build (module load), not at render time, and
`scripts/factory.mjs` grows assertions so declared metadata cannot drift from the code it
describes (e.g. a declared `two-person` structure on a template whose schema has one name
field fails the factory).

---

## 3. Facet A - programme families and formats

Answers "what are you making?". **[PROPOSAL]** 12 families, 60 formats. Family names are
user-facing and localizable; ids are stable kebab-case. Format names are normalized from the
workbook (source wording in §15 is preserved verbatim in the mapping; display names are
shortened for tiles).

The pack mapping (`packs.ts` `formats`) already ties every format to types; the facet reuses
that, but derives through the **graphic category**, not the individual `typeId`: *a template is
relevant to a format if the format's pack contains any type whose graphic category matches the
template's, or names the template's id in `extras`.* Category-level derivation is what gives
the ~30 unclaimed hand-written variants (classic lt01-lt13, cr04, ...) the same relevance as
their typed siblings - a per-`typeId` rule would leave them format-less and permanently
outranked. Manual widening stays possible via declared `extraFormats` (e.g. the versus card
for debate night even though vs01 sits in Match Day), and the factory caps it so hand-tagging
never becomes the norm.

Two bookkeeping rules that keep the derivation honest:
- **Format-id ↔ sheet bijection.** `packs.ts` stores the verbatim workbook strings; facet A
  introduces kebab ids. The format registry therefore carries `{ id, family, name,
  sheetName }` with `sheetName` the verbatim string, and the factory asserts a 1:1 mapping
  against the union of `PACKS[].formats` - a second 60-item list with no asserted bijection
  would be exactly the drift §2 forbids.
- **Universal graphics.** A future category that belongs everywhere (frames, QR/CTA) would
  either pollute every curated pack or derive nothing. A category may instead declare
  `relevance: 'all'` in the category registry - ranked below genuine format matches, above
  nothing. Packs stay curated kits; they are the *default* relevance source, not the only one.

| Family id | Display name | Formats (id - display name) |
|---|---|---|
| `sports` | Sports | `sports-broadcast` Sports broadcast · `amateur-sports` Amateur & local sports |
| `gaming` | Esports & gaming | `esports-tournament` Esports tournament · `gaming-stream` Gaming livestream · `tabletop` Tabletop & board games |
| `creator` | Streaming & creator | `just-chatting` Just Chatting · `irl-travel` Travel & IRL · `watch-party` Watch party & reactions · `coding-stream` Tech & coding · `art-stream` Art & design · `craft-stream` Craft & maker · `beauty-stream` Beauty & makeup · `cooking-stream` Cooking & food · `bts-production` Behind the scenes |

| `talk` | Talk & podcasts | `talk-show` Talk show & panel · `podcast` Podcast & videocast · `live-qa` Live Q&A / AMA · `remote-interview` Remote interview · `morning-show` Magazine & morning show · `radio-style` Radio-style stream · `book-launch` Book launch & author event |
| `business` | Business & corporate | `webinar` Webinar · `conference` Conference & seminar · `town-hall` Town hall & internal · `product-launch` Product launch & keynote · `virtual-event` Virtual event · `finance-live` Finance & markets |
| `education` | Education & training | `lecture` Lecture & class · `school-tv` Student & school TV · `academic-conference` Academic conference · `workshop` Workshop & training |
| `entertainment` | Music, stage & entertainment | `concert` Concert & live music · `award-show` Award show & gala · `theatre` Theatre & performance · `dj-set` DJ set & club · `quiz-show` Quiz & game show · `reality` Reality & house stream · `red-carpet` Red carpet & premiere · `fashion-show` Fashion show |

Counts per family: 2 / 3 / 9 / 5 / 7 / 6 / 4 / 8 / 4 / 4 / 5 / 3 = 60. ✓

Rules:
- A format has exactly one family (browse hierarchy); a **template** may match any number of
  formats (derived).
- Family tiles are the first browse level; a family expands to its formats; search reaches
  formats directly, so the hierarchy never blocks a user who knows the word ("church").
- Selecting a format **ranks, never hides** (§13) - untagged general-purpose templates stay
  discoverable.
- **Packs are not a facet.** A pack stays what it is: a curated starter kit (future "start
  from a pack" surface, still an open product decision per `PACK_TAXONOMY.md`). The facet and
  the packs share the format list, so they cannot drift.

Judgement calls worth flagging: finance sits in `business` not `news` (analyst register, not
newsroom); fitness in `wellness` not `sports` (class graphics, not match graphics); cooking and
beauty in `creator` (they are creator shows that *use* commerce graphics - the graphics stay
findable via facet B, which is the whole point of separating the axes).

---

## 4. Facet B - graphic categories

Answers "what graphic do you need?". **[PROPOSAL]** 26 normalized categories. Every template
declares exactly **one primary category** (predictable browsing), optional extra categories,
and one optional **subtype** from that category's controlled subtype list (no free-form tags).

Naming rule: functional, producer-friendly, no context words (`Lower thirds`, never
`Church lower thirds`) - context is facet A, arrangement facet C, look facet G.

| # | Id | Display name | Subtypes (controlled) | Today's home |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `lower-third` | Lower thirds | speaker, two-person, name-tag, locator, live-tag | category `lower-third`, type `lower-third` |
| 2 | `bug` | Bugs & corner logos | sponsor, station, live, social-handle, award | category `corner-bug`, type `sponsor-bug`; type `social-bug` (whose designs live in the `lower-third` grid today - lt14 family) |
| 3 | `title` | Titles & openers | show-open, session-title, segment-title, event-title | type `title-card` (in `info-card`) |
| 4 | `topic` | Topic & chapter cards | topic, chapter, now-playing, coming-up | type `topic-card` (in `info-card`) |
| 5 | `info` | Information cards | explainer, spec, key-term, step, checklist, fact | part of `info-card` |
| 6 | `question` | Questions & chat | viewer-question, qa-card, chat-highlight, queue | - (gap) |
| 7 | `quote` | Quotes & statements | quote, scripture, excerpt, headline, fact-check | - (gap; near `topic`) |
| 8 | `scoreboard` | Scoreboards | match-score, simple-score, round-indicator | category `scoreboard`, type `scoreboard` (note: shipped sb designs carry team+score fields and flag/clock/result groups - no period/round field yet; the round-indicator subtype is taxonomy-ahead-of-catalog) |
| 9 | `results` | Results & standings | results-table, leaderboard, bracket, seat-count, vote-result, final-score | - (gap; poll bars cover vote-result) |
| 10 | `stats` | Statistics & data | stat-panel, kpi, chart, heatmap, trend | - (gap, needs data feeds) |
| 11 | `timer` | Timers & clocks | countdown, count-up, clock, interval, speaking-timer, deal-timer | category `game-timer`, type `countdown` |
| 12 | `ticker` | Tickers & crawls | news-ticker, market-ticker, crawl, rotator | category `ticker`, type `ticker` |
| 13 | `alert` | Alerts & status | breaking, warning, emergency, status, notice | - (gap; ticker/topic partially cover) |
| 14 | `list` | Lists & schedules | agenda, schedule, lineup, setlist, ingredients, program, order | type `agenda` (in `infographic`) |
| 15 | `poll-quiz` | Polls, voting & quizzes | poll-result, vote, quiz-question, answer-board | type `poll` (in `infographic`), category `quiz`, type `quiz-board` |
| 16 | `progress` | Goals & progress | donation-goal, progress-bar, milestone, stock-level | - (gap, top of gap list) |
| 17 | `product` | Products & commerce | product-card, price, lot-bid, property, comparison | - (gap) |
| 18 | `cta` | Calls to action & QR | qr, link, follow, donate, buy | - (gap; QR rides image fields today) |
| 19 | `sponsor` | Sponsor & partner panels | panel, logo-strip, sponsor-read, rotation | - (gap; `bug` covers corners) |
| 20 | `frame` | Frames & layouts | webcam, split-screen, reaction, visualizer, background, screen-share | - (gap) |
| 21 | `holding` | Holding & break screens | starting, ending, brb, break, intermission | category `starting-soon`, type `holding-screen` |
| 22 | `credits` | Credits & thanks | end-credits, thank-you, donor-wall, role-credits | category `end-credits` |
| 23 | `caption` | Captions & lyrics | lyrics, surtitle, translation, caption | - (gap, timed-text runtime) |
| 24 | `reveal` | Reveals & matchups | versus, winner, nominee, before-after, sold | category `versus`; quiz reveal machinery |
| 25 | `map` | Maps & location | map, map-pin, route, weather-map, zone-map | - (gap, needs data/asset work) |
| 26 | `transition` | Stingers & wipes | stinger, replay-wipe | - (gap) |

Design decisions baked in:
- **Contextual variants are NOT categories.** Pastor/teacher/caster/player lower thirds are all
  `lower-third` + facet A tags (+ field semantics). The workbook's ~60 lower-third phrasings
  collapse into one category with 5 subtypes.
- `title` vs `topic` stay separate (the shipped types already distinguish them; a title names
  the *show/session*, a topic names *what is being discussed now*).
- **Coverage is not a category**: "full-screen graphics" from the brief's provisional list is
  facet F. An emergency instruction card is `info` + placement `full-screen`.
- `scoreboard` (live score-keeping, operator controls) vs `results` (settled outcomes) vs
  `stats` (measured data) are three categories because their data behaviour differs, which is
  what a user is choosing between.
- Categories with no catalog content today (11 of 26) **exist in the taxonomy but render no
  browse tile** until content ships (§12) - the taxonomy is built for the catalog the gap list
  already commits to, so the next 20 types need no taxonomy rewrite.

**Migration of the 12 current wizard categories** (per-variant where a category splits):

| Current | New primary category |
|---|---|
| `lower-third` | split per variant: `lower-third` (most), `bug`/social-handle (the lt14-family handle straps) |
| `ticker` | `ticker` |
| `scoreboard` | `scoreboard` |
| `info-card` | split per variant: `title` (card05 family), `topic` (card06 family), `info` (rest) |
| `starting-soon` | `holding` |
| `end-credits` | `credits` |
| `corner-bug` | `bug` |
| `infographic` | split per variant: `stats` (ig01 Big Stat, ig02 Glass Bars), `results` (ig03 Timing Tower), `poll-quiz` (ig04 Poll Ring, ig07 Election Bars, ig11-ig13 polls), `progress` (ig05 Rising Total), `list` (ig06, ig08-ig10 schedules) |
| `game-timer` | `timer` |
| `versus` | `reveal`/versus |
| `quiz` | `poll-quiz`/quiz-question |
| `imported-design` | none (user content, not browsable) |

Where a current category splits, the complete per-variant assignment is finalized in migration
stage 3 (§17); the table above is the working assignment. A variant that somehow reaches the
browser without an assignment falls back to a **single** per-old-category default (`lower-third`
→ `lower-third`, `info-card` → `info`, `infographic` → `stats`) so the fallback is always
well-defined.

`TemplateCategory` stays as the **assembler/routing id** (it names which code builds the
template); the graphic category becomes presentation metadata on top. No file moves, no id
renames - see §17.

---

## 5. Facet C - graphic structure

Answers "how is the information arranged?", independent of purpose. **[PROPOSAL]** 16 values,
declared per template (typically per type, inherited by its designs), multiple allowed:

| Id | Display name | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `single-line` | Single line | one-name strap, track ID |
| `multi-line` | Multi-line text | scripture card, statement |
| `name-role` | Name + role | classic lower third |
| `image-text` | Image + text | product card, guest photo strap |
| `logo-text` | Logo + text | sponsor read, team strap |
| `two-person` | Two people | interview double strap, versus |
| `multi-person` | Several people | lineup, panel board |
| `rows` | Repeating rows | agenda, lineup, results table |
| `table` | Table | standings, comparison |
| `grid` | Grid | product grid, nominee wall |
| `bars` | Bars & meters | poll bars, progress bar |
| `full-panel` | Full-screen panel | holding screen, explainer |
| `strip` | Horizontal strip | ticker, logo strip |
| `corner-chip` | Corner chip | bug, social handle |
| `side-panel` | Vertical panel | side stats, queue |
| `media-frame` | Video / webcam frame | webcam frame, split screen |

Rules: user-facing names only (never `flex-column`); a structure is about *information shape*,
so `rows` is the one that matters for "repeating players" whatever the graphic is; the factory
asserts declared structures against the schema where mechanically possible (`two-person` ⇒ ≥2
name-semantic fields; `rows` ⇒ a repeating/lines field).

---

## 6. Facet D - editable data fields

The user filters by **what they need to control**, not visual lines.

### 6.1 Derived counts [PROPOSAL]

From the compiled default schema (`variant.create()` → `SpxField[]` → `FieldDescriptor[]`),
computed at registry build, never hand-written:

```ts
fieldCounts: {
  visible: number    // operator-facing content fields; hidden config inputs EXCLUDED
  total: number      // everything operator-editable, hidden inputs included
  text: number       // kind text | lines
  number: number
  image: number      // kind image, logo excluded
  logo: number       // 0|1, from LogoSupport !== 'none'
  choice: number     // kind select | toggle | color
  repeating: number  // fields whose value is a delimited list (ticker items, agenda rows)
}
```

**Buckets count `visible`, not `total`** - operators think in the fields they see; a holding
screen's hidden countdown-minutes input must not push it from "2 fields" to "3". `total`
stays in metadata for the detail popover.

Filter buckets (facet UI): **1 · 2 · 3 · 4-5 · 6+ · repeating**. Both "exactly" and "at
least" is over-engineering for the initial release - **[PROPOSAL]** an "at least" mode ships
only if zero-result telemetry ever justifies it.

Bucket matching is **range intersection**, and that must be understood explicitly: `maxLines`
≠ line count, so a variant's reachable visible-field range is `defaults..(maxLines + extras)`.
A lower third with default 2 and maxLines 5 matches buckets 2, 3 AND 4-5 - one template can
sit under several chips, and bucket counts intentionally sum to more than the catalog. The
card disambiguates by showing the real numbers: "2 fields (up to 5)".

### 6.2 Field semantics [PROPOSAL]

New controlled vocabulary `FieldSemantic` (23 ids):

`name` · `role` · `organization` · `headline` · `description` · `topic` · `question` ·
`answer` · `score` · `team` · `price` · `discount` · `percentage` · `location` · `date` ·
`time` · `duration` · `url` · `social-handle` · `qr-content` · `image` · `logo` · `items`
(repeating source)

Where declared: `TypeField` gains optional `semantic?: FieldSemantic` (12 types cover 48 of 79
variants); the ~30 unclaimed hand-written variants declare a positional `fieldSemantics` array
in their meta entry, and the factory asserts its length equals the compiled schema length so a
field insertion fails loudly instead of silently shifting every semantic by one. Used for: search ("football score" hits `score`), the card's field summary
("2 names + 2 roles"), and future AI/brief matching. Not a filter chip in v1 - counts and
kinds filter; semantics search.

---

## 7. Facet E - functional capabilities

**[PROPOSAL]** Controlled `CapabilityId` list; derivation first, declaration for the rest:

| Id | Display | Derived from |
|---|---|---|
| `multi-step` | Step-by-step reveal | derived steps > 1 |
| `operator-states` | Operator-controlled states | machine has authored events beyond the walk |
| `loop` | Automatic loop | preset family (marquee, hold-loop, rotator) |
| `countdown` | Countdown | type `countdown` / timer semantics |
| `count-up` | Count-up timer | preset/type variant |
| `clock` | Clock | parallel `clock` group |
| `score-controls` | Score controls | scoreboard controls (increment/decrement) |
| `progress` | Progress bar | bars-grow/ring-fill runtimes on a goal value |
| `repeating` | Repeating list | repeating field present |
| `ticker` | Ticker / marquee | ticker runtime |
| `poll-states` | Poll & voting states | poll type |
| `quiz-states` | Correct / incorrect / lock | quiz-board branches |
| `winner-reveal` | Winner reveal | reveal branch (future type) |
| `alert-state` | Alert state | declared (future) |
| `image-upload` | Image upload | image field in schema |
| `logo-upload` | Logo upload | `logo !== 'none'` |
| `qr` | QR code | declared (image field today; generated later) |
| `live-data` | Live-updating data | declared (none today - honest zero) |
| `sponsor-rotation` | Sponsor rotation | declared (future) |
| `pause-resume` | Pause / resume control | machine controls |

Wizard exposes **at most 8** as filter checkboxes (multi-step, countdown, clock,
score-controls, progress, repeating, loop, image-upload); the rest stay searchable metadata
until they have catalog mass. Capability filters are **strict** (§13) - "has countdown" means
has countdown.

---

## 8. Facet F - placement & coverage

Derived: `defaultZone` (Zone9) gives the anchor; a **coverage class**
(overlay | strip | panel | full | frame) combines with it so zone + coverage → placement ids.
Coverage is declared **per type/design, not per category** - `reveal` spans full-frame versus
slams and card-sized nominee straps, `title` spans full-screen openers and small segment
labels, so a category-level class would misclassify half its members. The category supplies
only the *default*; a design overrides it the same way it overrides `defaultZone`. (Longer
term the bench already measures each graphic's box - coverage can then be derived from the
measured footprint and the declaration disappears.)

`full-screen` · `lower` · `upper` · `left` · `right` · `center` · `corner` · `side-panel` ·
`background` · `frame`

- A zone-movable overlay (most straps/cards) matches every zone placement, with its default
  ranked first - placement filters on *where it can sit*, defaulting is facet-neutral.
- Safe-area compliance is a platform invariant [FACT: zones are safe-area snapped by
  construction], not a filter.
- **Aspect ratio**: canvas format is a project-level choice in the wizard today [FACT]; all
  catalog templates are 1080p-authored and scale. **[PROPOSAL]** defer per-template
  `aspectRatios` metadata until vertical/square-specific designs exist; the schema reserves the
  field so adding them is additive. Filtering on aspect before any template differs by aspect
  would be a facet of nothing.

---

## 9. Facet G - visual style

Audit verdict [FACT]: the codebase has exactly one style system - the four families - with
palettes, fonts and shape tokens hanging off it. The brief's 22 adjectives would be a second,
unenforced vocabulary drifting beside it.

**[PROPOSAL]**
- The **filter** stays the four families, presented with fuller labels:
  `minimal` "Minimal & editorial" · `sport` "Sport & energetic" · `glass` "Elegant & cinematic"
  · `noacg` "Bold & on-air" (display names reviewable; ids frozen).
- The brief's adjectives become **style aliases** for search, mapped many-to-one:
  corporate/editorial/broadcast-news/flat/light → `minimal`; esports/gaming/energetic/bold →
  `sport`; luxury/cinematic/glass/futuristic/tech → `glass`; playful/youthful/retro? → `noacg`.
  (Alias table in §14; `retro` maps nowhere honestly - it's dropped rather than lied about.)
- A fifth family remains what `PACK_TAXONOMY.md` says it is: ~12 designed variants of real
  work, never a config knob. The taxonomy needs nothing new to absorb one.
- Palette light/dark is **not** a style facet (palettes are swappable per project in the Style
  step - filtering templates by a thing the next step freely changes would mislead).

---

## 10. Facet H - motion

Motion facts live in the preset registry, so the facet derives from `animationPresets`:

- **[PROPOSAL]** New per-preset table (one place, ~35 rows): each `AnimPresetId` gets
  `intensity: 'none' | 'subtle' | 'medium' | 'strong'` and `motionStyles: MotionStyleId[]`
  from `reveal` · `wipe` · `slide` · `pop` · `scale` · `blur` · `roll` · `loop` · `flip`.
- A template's motion facet = union over its offered presets; its **default intensity** = its
  default preset's intensity. Filter chips: intensity and, under More filters, motion style -
  and like category tiles, **only values with catalog mass render** (no preset ships intensity
  `none` today, so that chip simply doesn't appear rather than being a guaranteed-zero trap).
- Easing stays out of discovery (it's a per-project knob with its own doctrine
  [`DESIGN_LANGUAGE.md` §4]); "No animation" maps to intensity `none` (no preset today ships
  that - honest zero until one does).
- Motion intensity is deliberately disjoint from facet G: a minimal graphic can enter with a
  strong snap; the two axes never share ids.

## 11. The metadata model

**[PROPOSAL]** Adapted to the real architecture - the brief's flat `TemplateMetadata` is split
into the declared sliver and the derived bulk, because the catalog is *code*, not documents:

```ts
// ---- declared, per template (on GraphicType for typed variants,
// ---- in templates/meta.ts for unclaimed hand-written ones)
interface DeclaredMeta {
  graphicCategory: GraphicCategoryId          // the ONE primary category
  extraCategories?: GraphicCategoryId[]       // rare; browsing shows primary only
  subtype?: string                            // from the category's controlled list
  structures: StructureId[]
  fieldSemantics?: FieldSemantic[]            // positional; on TypeField as `semantic` instead
  extraCapabilities?: CapabilityId[]          // only the non-derivable ones (qr, live-data...)
  extraFormats?: ProgrammeFormatId[]          // widen beyond pack-derived relevance
  keywords?: string[]                         // controlled additions feeding search only
}

// ---- derived at registry build; factory-asserted; never hand-written
interface TemplateMeta extends DeclaredMeta {
  id: string                                  // the variant id (stable)
  name: string; description: string           // from the variant
  programmeFamilies: ProgrammeFamilyId[]      // from formats
  programmeFormats: ProgrammeFormatId[]       // pack membership of typeId + extraFormats
  fieldSchema: FieldDescriptor[]              // compiled default schema
  fieldCounts: FieldCounts                    // §6.1, incl. reachable line range
  capabilities: CapabilityId[]                // derived ∪ extraCapabilities
  placements: PlacementId[]                   // §8
  aspectRatios: AspectRatioId[]               // reserved; ['16x9'] for all today
  styleFamily: StyleTag                       // = styleTag
  motion: { intensity: MotionIntensity; styles: MotionStyleId[] }
  complexity: 'simple' | 'standard' | 'advanced'  // derived, §12.4
}
```

Requirements honoured:
- **Stable ids everywhere**; display labels live in one label map per facet (localization-ready,
  renames never touch stored ids).
- **No status field**: the catalog has no draft/beta lifecycle today - shipping variants are
  ready by definition (the factory gates them). Reserved for the community/nightly-library
  pipeline, where publish payloads will need `metaVersion` + status; **that** boundary gets the
  repo's standard version-and-migrate treatment. The in-repo catalog needs no migration
  machinery because meta is rebuilt from source every build.
- **The scale boundary is specified now, even though implementation is deferred.** Community,
  AI and nightly-generated templates have no `GraphicType` and no pack membership, so nothing
  derives for them unless the publish path enforces it. The contract: (a) every published
  template carries a versioned `TemplateMeta` payload; (b) `graphicCategory`, `subtype`,
  `structures` and semantics must come from the same closed id registries (unknown id =
  publish rejected, exactly like `validateTemplate` errors); (c) the derivable half
  (fieldCounts, capabilities from the parsed machine, placement, motion) is **recomputed
  server/import-side from the template code, never trusted from the payload**; (d) the
  generator prompt assigns the declared half and the nightly gate runs the same assertions the
  factory runs in-repo. This is where "Best for {format}" would otherwise starve and category
  assignment would otherwise go unpoliced at exactly the scale the product is committed to.
- **No free-form tags**: `keywords` is the one escape valve, feeds search only (never a
  filter), and the factory rejects a keyword that duplicates an existing facet value's label or
  alias - the "uncontrolled adjectives" failure mode is machine-blocked.
- **Multiple formats per template, one primary category** - both structural.
- Field counts derive from the real schema (§6.1), with the `maxLines` range nuance handled.

## 12. The Start-from-template browser

### 12.1 Flow [PROPOSAL]

The Entry step is untouched. "Start from a template" opens one **Browse step** replacing
today's Category → Template pair (the wizard keeps Fields → Style → Animation after a pick;
step hard-coding in `CreationWizard.tsx` is a §17 implementation concern):

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┬────────────┐
│ [🔍 Search all templates…                  ] │            │
│ What are you making? (optional)              │            │
│ [Sports ▾][Gaming ▾][News ▾]…  (families)    │  existing  │
│                                              │  live      │

│ Fields: [1][2][3][4-5][6+][↻]  Style: [4]    │  (WizardP.)│
│ ▸ More filters (structure·capabilities·      │            │
│    placement·motion)                         │            │
│ ── results ──────────────  n results  [sort] │            │
│ [card][card][card][card]…                    │            │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┴────────────┘
```

- **Default visible**: search, programme family/format (optional, collapsible), category tiles
  (with live counts, only categories that have content), field-count buckets, style family.
- **More filters**: structure, capabilities, placement, motion intensity. Aspect joins when
  aspect-specific templates exist.
- Category tiles double as the browse entry: no filters at all shows the tile grid first
  (today's mental model preserved); any search/filter input switches to the result grid.
- **Mobile (≤768px)**: filters collapse into a drawer button with an active-count badge; the
  established stacked preview behaviour stays.
- Result count always visible; active filters render as removable chips with "Clear all".
- Selecting a template proceeds to Fields exactly as today (`draft.variantId`); Back returns
  with filters intact (state lives in the draft for the wizard session, not ephemeral
  per-step as today's chips are).

### 12.2 Sorting [PROPOSAL]

`Relevance` (default, §13.3) and `Simplest first` (complexity, then visible-field count). **No
"Popular"** - the workbook stripped rankings and no usage data exists [FACT]; fabricating it
is refused. **No "Newest"** - variants carry no date; if wanted later, an `added:
'YYYY-MM'` field starts accruing from adoption day (backfill would be guesswork).

### 12.3 Template cards [PROPOSAL]

Existing `MiniPreview` still + name, plus a strict info budget:

```
[MiniPreview still]
House Schedule                        ← name
Lists & schedules · agenda            ← primary category · subtype
Business · Education                  ← top 2 families (by rank), never all
2 fields: heading + repeating rows    ← from fieldCounts + semantics
↻ repeating · ⏱ steps                 ← max 3 capability badges
Bold & on-air · Standard              ← style family · complexity
```

(Example is the real ig08; a made-up flagship would be exactly the fabrication this doc bans.)

Nothing else. Full field schema, all formats, presets etc. live in a hover/long-press detail
popover, not the card.

### 12.4 Complexity (derived)

`advanced` = machine has branches or parallel groups (quiz, scoreboard, ticker rotator,
clock-bearing holds) · `standard` = multi-step, timer, or >3 **visible** fields · `simple` =
rest. Logo support deliberately does not raise complexity (a built-in corner bug is the
simplest graphic in the catalog). Factory-computed, shown as a badge, filterable under More
filters.

---

## 13. Filter and ranking logic

### 13.1 Combination rules [PROPOSAL]

- Different facets: **AND**.
- Choices within one facet: **OR** (`church-service OR conference`).
- **Strict facets** (hide non-matches): category, field bucket, structure, capabilities,
  placement, style family, motion.
- **Ranking facet** (reorder, never hide): programme format/family. Results split into two
  labelled sections: "**Best for {format}**" (templates whose derived formats include it) and
  "**Also works**" (everything else passing the strict facets). A family-only selection uses
  the family form ("Best for sports productions") with derived-family matching. General-purpose
  templates are never buried by an untagged-means-invisible rule.
- Field bucket = range intersection over the reachable visible-field range (§6.1).

### 13.2 Zero results

Strict facets are never silently relaxed. The empty state says which chip(s) killed the result
set ("No lower thirds with a countdown - remove one?"), offers one-tap removal of the most
restrictive chip (defined mechanically: the chip whose removal restores the largest result
count), and always offers **Create with AI** carrying the active facet selection as
the brief seed. If the *taxonomy* matches but the *catalog* has no template (a `product` search
today), the empty state says that honestly - "No product cards yet" - not "nothing matches".

### 13.3 Relevance ranking

Deterministic, documented, no learned magic:

1. Search-text score (field-weighted, §14) - only when a query exists.
2. Programme-format match (selected format in derived formats): large boost; family-only
   match: smaller boost.
3. Pack curation order as the within-tier tiebreak (the packs' curated type order is the one
   editorial ranking that exists), then catalog order (stable).
4. Brand match (existing `matchBrand` behaviour - saved brand's family first) folds in as a
   small boost, replacing today's hard resort.

---

## 14. Search

### 14.1 Index

Client-side, built with the registry (78-few-hundred templates - no infra needed). Indexed
text per template, by weight: name (10) · category display name + subtype + aliases (8) ·
field semantics labels (6) · capability labels (5) · programme format/family names + aliases
(4) · structure labels (4) · keywords (3) · description (2). Normalization: lowercase,
diacritics folded, trivial plural fold (s/es). **Multi-word aliases match as phrases first**
("name tag", "starting soon" are looked up whole before tokenizing - a pure token-AND rule
would make "name tag" hit any template with "name" and "tag" anywhere in its index); remaining
tokens then AND across the index, each matching any field, prefix match on the last token for
as-you-type.

### 14.2 Alias table (the synonym mapping, deliverable 10)

Controlled, versioned in code beside the facet ids. Seed set - left side is what users type,
right side is the facet value it expands to:

| Alias | Resolves to |
|---|---|
| name graphic, name tag, nameplate, strap, super, chyron, L3 | category `lower-third` |
| corner logo, watermark, DOG, station id | category `bug` |
| viewer question, chat question, ama | category `question` |
| verse, scripture, bible | category `quote`/scripture |
| score, scorebug, score box | category `scoreboard` |
| standings, league table, leaderboard, bracket | category `results` |
| clock, stopwatch, timer | category `timer` |
| countdown | categories `timer` + `holding` (a "countdown to start" usually means a starting-soon screen) |
| sponsor | categories `bug` + `sponsor` (corner vs panel - the user shouldn't need to know the boundary) |
| award, winner, trophy | categories `reveal` + `results` + `bug`/award |
| crawl, marquee, headline bar | category `ticker` |
| breaking, breaking news | category `alert` + subtype breaking |
| agenda, schedule, running order, lineup, rundown | category `list` |
| vote, voting, poll, survey, quiz | category `poll-quiz` |
| donation bar, goal bar, fundraising meter, sub goal | category `progress` |
| price card, offer, deal, sale | category `product` |
| qr, link card | category `cta` |
| starting soon, brb, be right back, intermission, stream ending | category `holding` |
| outro, roll, credit roll | category `credits` |
| lyrics, surtitles, subtitles | category `caption` |
| versus, vs, head to head, matchup, face-off | category `reveal`/versus |
| stinger, wipe, transition | category `transition` |
| two person, double, dual, interview strap | structure `two-person` |
| church, worship, sermon | format `church-service` |
| football, soccer, basketball, hockey, handball | family `sports` |
| twitch, streamer, obs | family `creator` |
| corporate, business news, editorial, flat | style `minimal` |
| esports, energetic, gaming look | style `sport` |
| luxury, elegant, cinematic, futuristic, tech | style `glass` |
| playful, youthful | style `noacg` |

Growth rule: an alias is added when observed (support, chat logs, zero-result telemetry),
reviewed like config, and must resolve to existing facet values - the table cannot invent
taxonomy. **An alias may resolve to a set** (see countdown, sponsor, award): when a producer's
word legitimately spans categories, search fans out across all of them rather than forcing the
taxonomy's internal boundary onto the user.

### 14.3 Understanding the brief's examples

`name graphic` → alias → lower thirds. `corner logo` → alias → bugs. `viewer question` →
alias → questions. `football score` → alias family sports + semantic `score` → scoreboard
ranked for sports. `church verse` → format church + alias verse → scripture quotes ranked for
church. `two-person interview` → structure two-person + format remote-interview.

## 16. Validation - the 20 searches

Facet path → expected behaviour. "Catalog: ✓" = shipped templates match today; "gap" = the
taxonomy resolves but the catalog has no template - the honest empty state + AI hand-off
(§13.2) fires. Gap alignment with `PACK_TAXONOMY.md`'s list is noted - the taxonomy never
needed a rewrite to accommodate them.

| # | Request | Facets | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Two-field church speaker lower third | format church-service · cat lower-third · fields 2 | Catalog ✓ (lt*, minimal ranked via Church pack family) |
| 2 | Football scoreboard, clock + period | family sports · cat scoreboard · cap clock | Partial: score + clock ✓ (sb designs, parallel clock group); a period/round field ships on no sb design yet - soft gap the type's fields absorb without taxonomy change |
| 3 | Esports player card, image + stats | format esports · cat reveal/player or info · fields image+number | **gap** (player card - gap list "lineups/stats") |
| 4 | One-field minimal lower third | cat lower-third · fields 1 · style minimal | Catalog ✓ |
| 5 | Two-person remote interview layout | structure two-person · cat frame or lower-third | lower-third two-person: **gap**; frame: **gap** (gap list "frames") |
| 6 | Viewer question card, username + platform | cat question · semantics name+source | **gap** (question type - natural next type) |
| 7 | Full-screen emergency instructions | cat info/checklist · placement full-screen · format emergency-info | **gap** (topic/title cards near-miss; honest state) |
| 8 | Product card, price + discount + QR | cat product · caps qr | **gap** (gap list "QR") |
| 9 | Scripture, long multi-line | cat quote/scripture · structure multi-line | Partial: topic/info cards with textarea serve; dedicated quote design is a soft gap |
| 10 | Quiz question, 4 answers + timer | cat poll-quiz/quiz-question · cap countdown | Partial - and a strictness proof: quiz boards (qz*) have selected/locked branches but NO countdown, so the strict capability chip honestly empties the result; dropping the chip finds qz*, and countdowns live in `timer` (gt*) as a second graphic. A timed quiz board is a soft gap |
| 11 | Donation goal, live progress | cat progress · cap progress | **gap** (gap list #1 - goal type) |
| 12 | News ticker with breaking state | cat ticker · cap alert-state | Ticker ✓; breaking *state* gap (alert-state on ticker = future machine branch) |
| 13 | Conference agenda, repeating rows | cat list/agenda · cap repeating · format conference | Catalog ✓ (ig08 family) |
| 14 | Podcast now-playing card | format podcast · cat topic/now-playing | Catalog ✓ (topic cards ranked for Talk pack) |
| 15 | Property card, image + price + contact | cat product/property | **gap** |
| 16 | Municipal vote result | format council-meeting · cat poll-quiz/vote | Catalog ✓ (ig11 poll; PACK_TAXONOMY maps council → Election pack) |
| 17 | Lower third for IRL chat stream | format irl-travel or just-chatting · cat lower-third | Catalog ✓ (noacg family ranked via Creator pack) |
| 18 | Three-field academic speaker lower third | format academic-conference · cat lower-third · fields 3 | Catalog ✓ (maxLines ≥ 3 straps; range match §6.1) |
| 19 | Sports lineup, repeating players | family sports · cat list/lineup · cap repeating | Partial: agenda rows serve; dedicated lineup is a gap-list item |
| 20 | Full-screen graphic, exactly two text fields | placement full-screen · fields 2 | Catalog ✓ (holding screens, full-screen title cards). Two rules earn this row: coverage class makes "full-screen" answerable, and visible-field counting (§6.1) keeps a holding screen's hidden minutes input from pushing it out of bucket 2 |

Failure-mode review the brief asks for:
- **Zero results**: 7 of 20 are catalog gaps - and they cluster exactly on the pre-existing
  gap list, confirming the taxonomy is ahead of the catalog, not mismatched to it. The
  empty-state contract (§13.2) turns each into an honest answer plus an AI hand-off.
- **Too many results**: "lower third" alone returns ~20 - the format ranking sections plus
  field buckets cut that in one gesture; primary-category-only browsing keeps a variant from
  appearing under three tiles.
- **Misleading matches**: the two known traps are handled structurally - coverage class keeps
  corner bugs out of "full-screen" (#20), and strict capability semantics keep a static
  countdown *image* from matching "has countdown" because `countdown` derives from the type's
  clock group, not from a keyword.

## 17. Migration & rollout plan

Ordered so every stage ships green on its own; no stage renames existing ids.

1. **Facet registries** (pure additive code): facet id unions + label maps + alias table +
   per-preset motion table + coverage classes. No behaviour change.
2. **Derivation layer**: `templateMeta(variant)` computing §11 at registry build;
   `factory.mjs` gains the meta assertions (declared-vs-schema consistency, keyword rules,
   every variant resolves a primary category).
3. **Declared meta**: `semantic` on the 12 types' fields; a `templates/meta.ts` table for the
   ~30 unclaimed hand-written variants (primary category, subtype, structures, positional
   semantics). The per-variant splits of `lower-third`/`info-card`/`infographic` (§4) are
   finalized here as metadata - `TemplateCategory` and all file layout stay untouched.
4. **Search + Browse step** behind the existing wizard: new BrowseStep replaces
   CategoryStep+TemplateStep for `mode==='template'`; the hard-coded step indices in
   `CreationWizard.tsx` are re-based once (audit located every literal). MiniPreview, WizardPreview,
   draft flow, `variant.create(options)` contract: unchanged.
5. **E2E**: new browse/filter/search specs; `wizard-filters.spec.ts` migrates to the new chips.
6. **Later, separately**: pack surface ("start from a kit"), the community/nightly publish
   contract of §11 (versioned payload, closed-registry validation, server-side recomputation
   of the derived half), zero-result telemetry, alias growth loop, new types for the gap
   categories (question, goal/progress, product, QR, reveal - the gap list already orders
   them by evidence).

Fallback behaviour: a variant with no declared meta gets a derived-only record (category from
its current `TemplateCategory` via the §4 mapping table, no subtype/structures) - the browser
never crashes on a lazy variant; the factory just flags it.

## 18. Risks, ambiguities, recommended decisions

**Recommended decisions (need a yes/no):**
1. **26-category set + per-variant split of `info-card`/`infographic`** (§4). Alternative: keep
   the coarse 12 and add only subtypes - cheaper, but "Questions", "Products", "Progress" then
   have no browsable home when their types ship, and the split would happen later anyway.
   Recommend: adopt 26 now, tiles render only non-empty (11 tiles day one - same visual
   density as today).
2. **Programme format = ranking, not filter** (§13.1). The strongest single UX decision in
   this proposal; the alternative (strict filter) hides every general-purpose template and
   makes 60 formats × sparse tagging a zero-result machine.
3. **Field buckets are exact ranges over the reachable range** (§6.1), no at-least/exactly
   toggle in v1.
4. **No Popular / no Newest sort** (§12.2) until real data exists; `added` field starts
   accruing on adoption if Newest is wanted.
5. **Style filter stays the 4 families**; adjectives are aliases (§9). A style-vocabulary
   rewrite is a design-system project, not a discovery project.
6. **Meta lives on types + one sidecar table**, derived bulk computed at build (§11) - not a
   parallel hand-written JSON per template.

**Risks / ambiguities:**
- **Two category systems during transition** (assembler `TemplateCategory` vs graphic
  category). Mitigated: one mapping table, factory-asserted, and `TemplateCategory` is
  explicitly demoted to a routing id - but every doc touching "category" needs a pass at
  implementation time.
- **Packs do double duty** (curated kit + relevance source). Category-level derivation and
  `relevance: 'all'` (§3) remove the worst failure modes (format-less classics, universal
  types forced into every kit), but the tension is permanent: adding a type to a pack now
  also changes discovery ranking. Review pack edits with both hats on; `extraFormats`
  over-use would recreate hand tagging, so the factory caps declared widening.
- **`question`/chat-highlight overlaps show-chat territory.** `PACK_TAXONOMY.md` explicitly
  left chat/alert overlays as a product decision near `src/community/showchat`. The category
  exists in the taxonomy either way; whether its chat-highlight subtype eventually *binds*
  show-chat data or stays a hand-filled template is that same open decision - the taxonomy
  does not preempt it.
- **Semantics on positional fields** for hand-written variants is order-fragile; the factory
  must assert length == schema length so a field insertion fails loudly.
- **The alias table is English-first.** Ids are stable and labels localizable, but alias
  quality in other languages is future work (per-locale alias sets slot into the same table).
- **Search over ~80 templates is trivial; over a nightly-generated library of thousands**
  (the committed direction) the same index + facets hold, but ranking will need the telemetry
  loop - flagged so nobody assumes the v1 ranking is the end state.
- **Zone9 `defaultZone` under-specifies placement for full-canvas graphics** - the coverage
  class per category fixes it, but imported designs have neither; they stay outside browse
  (correct: they're the user's own content).

**Open questions [OPEN]:**
- Should the pack ("kit") surface land in the same Browse step as a third browse mode
  (Formats / Categories / Kits), or stay a separate Entry card? (PACK_TAXONOMY left this
  open; the facet work doesn't depend on the answer.)
- Do `title` and `topic` read as distinct to non-technical users, or should the tiles merge
  ("Titles & topics") while the taxonomy keeps both ids underneath?
- Is `noacg` as a user-facing style label ("Bold & on-air") right, or should the house family
  present as the default/unlabelled look?
- Light/dark: palettes make it a project knob today - confirm it stays out of discovery.
