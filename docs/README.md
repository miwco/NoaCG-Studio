# docs/ — what to trust, and for what

The map of this directory. Every file listed below is classified by what it is TODAY; a doc whose
header says HISTORICAL is kept for rationale and must not be read as current behaviour.
When work changes what a binding doc describes, update the doc in the same PR (root
`AGENTS.md` rule); when a plan finishes, mark it historical here and in its header rather
than letting it read as open.

**The map is COMPLETE, and `npm run build` keeps it that way.** `scripts/check-docs-index.mjs`
fails the build when a `docs/*.md` file has no row here, when a row names a file that is not
there, or when two rows name the same file. So absence from these tables IS evidence that a doc
does not exist - which is the only reading that makes the map worth consulting. Add the row in
the same commit as the doc. Subdirectories are exempt on purpose and described at the bottom
instead: `backlog/` has its own README contract, `handoffs/` is one file per session, and
`acceptance/owner-queue/` is transient by design.

Layers of documentation, top to bottom:

1. **Vision & principles** — root `AGENTS.md` (identity + non-negotiables),
   `GOALS.md` (north star, business posture, and the OPEN roadmap; shipped milestones live in
   `GOALS_ARCHIVE.md`).
2. **Cross-domain architecture** — `ARCHITECTURE.md` (binding, machine-enforced).
3. **Domain contracts** — nested `AGENTS.md` files (with thin `CLAUDE.md` imports) plus the
   binding docs below.
4. **Active plans** — work that is decided but not done.
5. **Rationale / historical** — completed plans and measurement records, kept because they
   explain why the code is shaped the way it is. Git preserves everything; these stay
   because they are still *read*, not because deleting them is hard.

## Binding contracts (current truth — keep updated)

| Doc | Contract for |
|---|---|
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | The modular monolith: domain registry, allowed import edges, debts. Machine-enforced (eslint + dependency-cruiser). Also holds the two reference maps the root `AGENTS.md` points at - §8 the repository map (what lives in each directory, and which carry their own `AGENTS.md`) and §9 the ten pages and their URLs. |
| `STATE_MACHINE_SCHEMA.md` | What a graphic IS: `NOACG_ANIM` v2, states/transitions/events, the default path, snap, versioning doctrine (§5), the node editor. |
| `GRAPHIC_TYPES.md` | The type registry: type vs design, the six promotion gates, the factory. |
| `PACK_TAXONOMY.md` | The 60 reference formats → packs mapping, the nine sports discipline packs, and the gap list. |
| `SPORTS_PACK.md` | The sports pack: 5 types × 4 families, the match clock, the fixtures board, and the capability matrix of every shared type it uses or extends. |
| `COMPETITION_PACK.md` | The esports / competition / result / reveal pack: its 12 types, their state flows and events, and how the four categories share one assembler. |
| `PUBLIC_SERVICE_PACK.md` | Tickers, alerts and public information: the capability matrix, what "a real ticker" and "a real alert state" mean, and the platform limits the pack ran into. |
| `CONTROL_LAYER.md` | Operator surfaces: the one generator, the ControlMessage protocol, shows, hosted control (migration 0008), staging + event log. |
| `OGRAF_STATE_IN_FIELDS.md` | How a behaviour's operator-visible state reaches a controller that is not ours, on OGraf v1 as it actually is: the controller owns the fact and the graphic obeys it, mirrored into a FIELD, because the standard has no return channel. Binding for every behaviour authored from 2026-08-30. Says which of a poll's three facts it serves well (the tally completely, the status at the price of one prohibition) and which it cannot express at all (legality), and states its own expiry. The upstream gap is `ebu/ograf` issue 82. |
| `CONTROL_PANEL_PARITY.md` | MEASURED, 2026-08-09: what an operator can actually do on `#/control/<id>` for a lower third and for each interactive type (quiz, live vote, scoreboard, countdown), the nine gaps ranked, and what a Lite-generated interactive graphic would need on top. |
| `SAVED_CONTENT_MODEL.md` | The library: GraphicDoc, packages-as-folders, hash routes, control entries, Save semantics. |
| `DESIGN_LANGUAGE.md` | The taste bar: typography, color, motion doctrine, the §8 family tokens, generated-code style. |
| `TASTE_RUBRIC.md` | THE REVIEWER: four yes/no checks a person can answer from a screenshot - too much text, generic AI copy, dead controls, self-evident. Owner rulings only; it never changes from an agent decision or a measurement. The machine-checkable half of check 2 is `scripts/check-copy.mjs` in the build; anything needing a threshold belongs in the instrument that measures it, not here. |
| `FOOTPRINT_STABILITY.md` | The STAGE contract: which graphics may change size with the operator text and which may not, the width and height mechanism behind it, and the measurements that shaped both. Summarised in `src/templates/AGENTS.md`. |
| `LOGO_SLOT.md` | The shared logo slot: the two arrangements and why beside beats above on a strap, the lockup wrapper, the three rules for injecting markup into a design you cannot see, the mark's three measured sizes, and every recorded exception. Summarised in `src/templates/AGENTS.md`; where a mark is PERMITTED at all is `MARK_CAPABILITY_AUDIT.md`. |
| `LOWER_THIRD_SHAPES_BRIEF.md` | The standing drawing brief behind the catalog queue's missing-silhouette item: the measurement (99 of 103 lower thirds are one silhouette), the owner ruling that sameness is a defect rather than a house style, and the six shapes to draw. |
| `KIT_MATRIX_GAPS.md` | The standing kit gap report: the (type × family) matrix as it resolves, the core six a kit owes a show, and which designs no kit can reach. |
| `CATALOG_VARIETY.md` | INVESTIGATION, unscheduled (2026-08-09): where the catalog's sameness actually comes from, measured off the emitted code — the style family predicts 3 of 14 visible decisions and the graphic category predicts the rest; the 119 kit-unreachable designs triaged; what is missing entirely; a proposal for design DIRECTIONS scoped to a kit, with a distinctness gate and a cost per direction; and the palette-freedom measurement (148 designs cannot take a light palette). |
| `CATALOG_WORK_QUEUE.md` | THE QUEUE (2026-08-21): what the catalog still owes, ordered, with the measurement under each item — the missing lower-third SHAPES (99 of 103 designs are one silhouette), the first-page ordering that is already built, the `ig01` re-file, and the standing debts. Carries the owner's binding position that sameness is a defect, not a house style. Its drawing brief is `LOWER_THIRD_SHAPES_BRIEF.md`. |
| `LOOKS_AND_PALETTES.md` | NOTE, unscheduled: measured evidence that the catalog reads as one product (four families, four palettes, four faces, almost all dark-panel), what more looks would cost, and the anti-slop rules any new look is held to. **Superseded on the measurement by `CATALOG_VARIETY.md`** — the declared axes are not where the sameness lives. |
| `SPX_TEMPLATE_FORMAT.md` | The external SPX contract this product targets (reference; keep in sync with SPX). |
| `TIMELINE_INTERACTION_MODEL.md` | The editing surfaces' interaction contract (selection, keyframes, playhead, what NoaCG deliberately does not copy from NLEs). |
| `IMPORT_MVP.md` | The Import Graphic flow: the structure contract, fit modes, Prepare/erase, 9-slice stretch. Shipped; doubles as the domain record. |
| `RENDER.md` | The render service: manifest kinds, virtual clock, tiers, security posture, deploy checklist. |
| `ADMIN.md` | The private admin surface and the entitlement system: the resolver and its precedence, plans/grants/overrides, roles, the 404-not-403 gate, the audit log, the internal-account usage scope, the beta feedback inbox, migrations 0017+. |
| `MODEL_ROUTE_AUDITS.md` | The register of hand-performed audits behind `APPROVED_MODEL_CATALOG` - how a ZDR audit is done, and one section per audited route. A `zdrAvailable: true` entry with nothing here is an unbacked privacy claim. |
| `DATA_API.md` | The Production Data API, for the external integrator: per-production data key, `POST /api/data/update`, field-label mapping, ordering guarantees, rate limits, curl examples. The server-side ingress of `CLOUD_PLAYOUT.md` §7. |
| `AGENT_CLI.md` | The agent door: the `noacg` CLI + MCP server, the `/bridge` page it drives, the dual graphic package (SPX sources + generated OGraf half), the contract-only skill, containment. |
| `AGENT_SAVE.md` | How an agent's CLI saves into a user's library: scoped agent keys + the permission vocabulary, the loopback one-time-code handoff, `POST /api/me/graphics` (the server never executes template code), the error table, and the library->air gates at publish and export. |
| `SPORTSDB.md` | The TheSportsDB connector: what the free V1 API actually offers (verified, incl. why it is NOT a real-time scoring feed), the normalized sports contract, the production-data patch it emits, and the one write call still blocked on the production-data contract. |
| `EXPORT_TARGETS_RESEARCH.md` | Where exports run: shipped targets + the doctrine for adding one. |
| `PLAYOUT_INTEGRATION.md` | The USER-facing setup guide for the playout side: choosing between the cloud output URL, self-hosted output and portable export, then CasparCG (incl. which server versions carry the old CEF), OBS, vMix and SPX, with a troubleshooting table and an explicit statement of what has been tested on real hardware. |
| `NATIVE_PLAYOUT_RESEARCH.md` | RESEARCH, nothing built (2026-08-16): what it would take for NoaCG to reach SDI / NDI / IP without CasparCG, OBS or vMix. Why SDI is inherently a local box (Singular included), the four routes with their real costs and licences (AMCP client, forking the server, our own CEF-based agent, GStreamer), the playout problems a graphics-only scope avoids, and the staged order if it is ever done. Verdict: own the client and the agent, rent the engine. |
| `GRAPHIC_BEHAVIOUR_PLAN.md` | How an imported graphic gets its BEHAVIOUR without code. §1-§9 are the plan as written for review on 2026-08-22 (a shipped behaviour taken apart into machine, controls, structure and LOOK; three doors offered without picking; the now-vs-later scoping). **§10 is what was BUILT the same day and is what stands**: the scoreboard needed no code, the quiz is a pilot reusing the answer board's machine and buttons with a new paint - the designer's own hidden layers shown by the machine - and the registry stays deferred until a third behaviour exists. Walked in a browser, pinned by `e2e/import-svg-behaviour.spec.ts`; designer-facing half in `SVG_AUTHORING.md` §5b. |
| `SCORE_CONTROL_SURVEY.md` | RESEARCH, 2026-09-04: how twenty-odd products shape a score control - SPX's own scoreboard extension, the CasparCG community clients, vMix, Singular, four OBS tools, NewBlue, the Daktronics / OES / Sportable venue consoles and a dozen classroom scorekeepers - read before the score behaviour's verbs were chosen, because a design default is not a taste question. Five answers: the increment is a row of fixed amounts and the amounts are the sport's own; the correction is a symmetric minus PLUS typing the true score, never undo alone; "Reset" means new game and names its own scope; amounts past 1 are standard wherever the graphic is a real sport, so they have to be author data; and the label is the signed amount, with the team coming from the column. **Its "How to read this" section is part of the record**: a first draft covered products the research never actually fetched, was retracted, and the page names what was and was not surveyed. |
| `COMPETITOR_MXMZ.md` | RESEARCH, 2026-08-22 and re-read 2026-08-28, public sources only: what MXMZ (named by Yle as the working model) actually ships - the Illustrator/Figma → SVG → browser keyframe timeline → one-URL-per-channel workflow, their prices and customers - and the finding that shapes our own road: nothing public shows them AUTHORING logic. They train the designer for a day, keep the operator as the non-technical one, and hand-build a control panel per sport. **Section 8 is the correction**: that finding covers authored logic ONLY, and on the AI question the competition is an assembly layer above the graphics engine (HighField AI, which names MXMZ as one of four engines it drives) rather than anyone generating a graphic. What to take, what not to. |
| `COMPETITORS.md` | The capability matrix: MXMZ, Singular.live, Loopic and Rive, each capability marked they-have / we-match / we-beat / GAP, with UNRESEARCHED said out loud where nobody has looked. Assembled from the docs below rather than from new research; refreshed on TIME, not on commits. A GAP row is candidate work - the largest one is assembly from newsroom context. |
| `ROUTINES.md` | The standing scheduled routines - weekly feedback + freshness, monthly competitor review, monthly quality review. What each does, when it runs, and why it is a report rather than a gate - including where the competitor review's OGraf findings get written down, and why the routine prints that block instead of writing it. Also records the parked mail feedback digest and the four secrets that would turn it on. |
| `FORMATTING.md` | What Prettier may and may not touch, and why. |
| `DEV_PORTS.md` | Per-worktree dev-port reservation. |
| `DEPLOYMENT.md` | CI + Vercel production runbook: the pipeline, the 12-function budget, deploy verification (`deploy-verify.yml`, `version.json`), opt-in previews, rolling-issue alerts, and where to look when production stops updating. |
| `AI_LITE_BENCHMARK.md` | The NoaCG Lite model-evaluation benchmark: the context-assembly trace, the shared compile pipeline (`src/ai/lite/pipeline.ts`), suites, calibration, regression vs model comparison, blind review, storage boundaries. |
| `AI_LITE_PROMOTION.md` | Lite route promotion policy: eligibility gates (thresholds owner-TODO), ranking, the proposed-route output, and the manual broadcast verification checklist. |
| `AI_LITE_PLAN.md` | ACTIVE PLAN: how Lite gets good and stays inside the ~€0.01 budget - what the 2026-08-07 switch-on and first real round measured, the route table with live prices, what the model decides vs the platform, why the judge stays off, and the build order. |
| `ACCEPTANCE_SPX_CASPARCG.md` | OPEN manual checklist: the parts of acceptance only a real SPX/CasparCG stack can prove. Not yet run. |
| `GOALS.md` | THE ONE ROADMAP: the north star, the business posture, and only what is NOT done. The ~200-line budget is stated in its own opening paragraph; a landed goal moves verbatim to `GOALS_ARCHIVE.md`. `## NOW` is the push and everything below it is parked, except to the extent an ACTIVE programme in `PROGRAMMES.md` states. |
| `PROGRAMMES.md` | THE REGISTER, ratified 2026-09-01: which long-running programmes the owner has authorized, each programme's state, entry conditions, scope edges and reopen triggers. Only the owner writes AUTHORIZED; the orchestrator advances ACTIVE programmes without per-step permission. The argument and claims are `NORTH_STAR_2027.md`. |
| `VERIFICATION.md` | The full verification procedure behind root `AGENTS.md`'s rules: which suite to run, why the pre-merge gate lives in CI rather than the laptop, how a run is read job-by-job, and what each catalog gate measures. |
| `MISTAKE_TRIGGERS.md` | Which recurring lessons become HOOKS, which belong in a build gate, and which are judgements no mechanism can hold. The four tests for a tool shape, the refuse-or-warn rule, how a hook is verified by feeding the real hook a real event, and the inventory of what fires today. |
| `AGENT_WORKFLOWS.md` | How one set of project rules serves Claude Code and Codex: the canonical sources in `.agent-workflows/`, the thin adapters under `.claude/commands/` and `.agents/skills/`, and the build check that fails when they drift. |
| `BRANCHING_AND_LANDING.md` | The full git contract behind root `AGENTS.md`'s `## Git` rules, with the incident that produced each one: why a session works in its own worktree, why the checkout holding `main` belongs to the landing queue, how `/queue-merge` serializes landing, and the migration and cleanup mechanisms. |
| `CI_STABILITY.md` | The classification of what keeps breaking and what stops each class - written to the owner's 2026-08-29 question about daily failure mail. Names the instrument per class rather than a list of past fixes. |
| `PRERENDER.md` | The static prerender step (`scripts/prerender.mjs`, run after `vite build`): the crawlable HTML it writes into `dist/`, one page per catalog design. |
| `STACK_FRESHNESS.md` | The register of everything `npm` cannot see - vendored GSAP/Lottie, pinned model ids - and the TIME-driven `check:freshness` report that watches it. Reports weekly; never a gate, and nothing auto-upgrades. |
| `PROJECT_FORMATS.md` | The hybrid authored-format / output-format model: the settings every new SPX graphic and video project chooses before template assembly. |
| `PLAYOUT_COMPATIBILITY.md` | The AUTHORING contract for templates that survive a playout browser. `PLAYOUT_INTEGRATION.md` is the operator's guide to the same subject. |
| `PLAYOUT_DASHBOARD.md` | Binding design contract for the surface an operator drives a production from - owner-specified 2026-08-05, one dashboard across three deployments. |
| `CLOUD_PLAYOUT.md` | Binding contract for PRODUCTIONS: the one persistent browser-output URL a production client loads once, and the operator workflow that prepares and airs graphics through it. |
| `CASPARCG_CONNECT.md` | One configured CasparCG server, one button to air, from the production page - the server set up once under Settings instead of retyped per show. The operator never opens the CasparCG Client. |
| `OGRAF.md` | The OGraf v1 export contract, written for the engineer loading one of our packages into their renderer: what we emit, what maps to what, and where the limits are. |
| `OGRAF_FIRST_REVIEW.md` | RATIFIED 2026-08-29 with four amendments: OGraf as the canonical interchange and playout contract, the NoaCG-native/code-as-truth authoring model, and what the standard does and does not give us. |
| `MARK_CAPABILITY_AUDIT.md` | OPEN AUDIT (2026-08-21): where a brand mark is actually permitted, across the three levels of the mechanism - a type PERMITS, a design IMPLEMENTS, a design PLACES - and the 44 types not yet acted on. The arrangement rules are `LOGO_SLOT.md`. |
| `TICKERS.md` | Tickers have exactly ONE field: a multi-line `textarea` (`f0`) carrying the whole rundown, because a rundown of stories is not a list of fields. |
| `END_CREDITS.md` | End credits have exactly ONE field, for the same reason as tickers: a credit roll is a list of people, not a list of fields. |
| `GRAPHICS_PACKS.md` | The `.noacgpack.json` format: several finished templates installing as one production, with graphics pooled, playout layers set and a cue rundown seeded. Nothing needs the editor. |
| `SVG_AUTHORING.md` | The author-facing contract for an SVG that imports well - what to do in Illustrator, Figma or Inkscape so text layers become operator fields and nothing is redrawn. |
| `DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md` | The WHY layer under `DESIGN_LANGUAGE.md`: the general principles the house's specific numbers implement, stated to apply to any graphic rather than to lower thirds. |
| `AI_PROVIDER_GATEWAY.md` | The model gateway: the transport layer under `AIProvider`, which stays the product-level interface. The harness still owns DesignSpec routing, validation, repair and graphic-type context. |
| `AI_TASK_REGISTRY.md` | The two server-only modules every NoaCG-funded model call passes: a task declares what it needs, and the approved-route catalog serves it or refuses. The browser never sees either. |
| `FUNNEL_EVENTS.md` | The optional first-party product analytics: whether people successfully create and export, and which creation doors need work. Deliberately smaller than general analytics - no click stream, no session replay. |
| `HARNESS_ROUTING.md` | APPEND-ONLY: what each of the three harnesses is actually good for, from measurement rather than impression. A session that routes work somewhere adds a dated entry; nothing earlier is rewritten. |
| `acceptance/IMPORTED_QUIZ_HOSTED_WALK.md` | Owner walk, ~15 min. **Step 1 RUN AND PASSED 2026-08-22** against the real project - the drawn states cross the wire and boot recovery repaints them, which was the one predicted failure. Step 2 (the eyes-on half) still owed. the imported quiz on the HOSTED road - published production, real `/output` renderer, and the renderer reboot mid-lock that is the pilot's one predicted failure. Half of it is `e2e/configured/imported-quiz-output.spec.ts` (one command, five frame pairs); the other half is the eyes-on question of whether the mapping step reads as usable without training. Says what a green run does NOT cover. |

## Active plans (decided, not done)

| Doc | State |
|---|---|
| `TEXT_BOX_BINDING.md` | Text and its box: every field lives in the shape drawn under it, the text owns its alignment, the box owns its growth. Owner walk 2026-09-02; three measured defects, one fixed. Design only. |
| `GROWTH_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` | The adoption push. Locked 2026-07-08; only open signup done. The §9 backlog is the work queue when growth resumes. |
| `NIGHTLY_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md` | Era 7. Job A (CI/health gates) built; generation jobs B/C plan-only, waiting on the §10 decisions (they spend real money nightly). |
| `VIDEO_DESIGN_QUALITY_PLAN.md` | Video AI quality. Most of it landed (arm B, fonts, readability gates); still open: the experiment-gated vision critic (§3.5) and the chip-set palette decision (§3.6). |
| `AI_WIZARD_PLAN.md` | Create-with-AI review + six-phase plan (2026-07-24). **Phases 1, 2, 4 and 6 built** — every offline-provable phase is done (visual alternatives + non-destructive refine; one thread with conversation-as-context, mid-thread attachments and "3 more like this"; brand colours from an uploaded logo + saved looks; the on-air readiness report + cost expectation). Only **phases 3 and 5 remain, and both spend real API money**. One open question: whether the thread should persist (§6.2). |
| `ADAPT_FIRST_PLAN.md` | The Create-with-AI pivot toward adapting proven designs (2026-08-03). **Stage R (retrieval), Stage P (the chassis keeps its zone) and the size clamp are built**; §1 is the catalog geometry measurement behind them (`scripts/catalog-geometry.mjs`, 430 variants) and §7 is the evaluation plan. Open and each priced in §6: re-baselining the adapt path, folding Lite onto the platform zone rule, and the paid shortlist-vs-digest round. |
| `NOACG_PRO_PLAN.md` | OWNER-APPROVED DIRECTION AND ACTIVE ROADMAP (promoted from parked 2026-08-11): NoaCG Pro, the open broadcast-graphics specialist, with Phase 0 as its implementation slice. |
| `NOACG_VIDEO_PLAN.md` | OWNER-APPROVED, scheduled behind Pro Phase 0: broadcast-grade stingers, intros and overlay animations out of cheap models. |
| `SVG_IMPORT_PLAN.md` | BINDING PLAN, owner-directed 2026-08-20 and north-star material: a designer's own SVG becomes a playable graphic. "SVG is code" is the insight the raster Import Graphic path cannot reach. |
| `SVG_ANIMATION_DIRECTION.md` | Design review 2026-08-28: how continuous on-air motion - moving patterns, looping accents, animated masks and glows - reaches an SVG-based graphic, given that SVG supplies artwork and layer structure and NoaCG supplies the motion. |
| `SVG_STATES_FROM_ARTWORK.md` | Design picture 2026-09-01 (P2 round-2 input, awaiting the owner's §7 rulings): how an imported graphic's state moments become VISIBLE - the default-treatment / drawn-layer / naming ladder, and the artwork contract a student can follow. |
| `TEAMS_PLAN.md` | P1 Teams design, 2026-09-01, AWAITING RATIFICATION (ratifying it flips P1 ACTIVE): server-authoritative team productions beside untouched personal libraries - teams, join codes, the CAS save story, and the three-student e2e. Mockups in `docs/design/teams/`. |
| `INTERACTIVE_PLAYOUT_PLAN.md` | The durable tracker for the interactive-playout program: the controlled quiz workflow, the generic sports controller, the public audience page (Phase 5), moderation, and polls. |
| `PRODUCTION_DATA_PLAN.md` | A production as a TREE OF LIVE VALUES its graphics read from, so an external system says "the home score is 4" and never "sb03 is on air". |
| `CONTROL_PANEL_ROAD.md` | A PLAN, rewritten 2026-08-28 from the owner's brief. It builds nothing: how a user's own graphic gets a control panel, restated as a road. |
| `DESIGN_RULES_PLAN.md` | RATIFIED PLAN 2026-08-18: legible, robust, airable BY MEASUREMENT - the owner's brief mapped onto the architecture that exists, and sequenced. |
| `EDITOR_RESEARCH.md` | The direction document for the NoaCG authoring system, written to the owner's master brief (2026-08-28). Second edition; it replaces the first entirely. |
| `BEHAVIOUR_AUTHORING_RESEARCH.md` | The P2 standing research thread, round 1 (2026-09-01): why the node editor failed as a non-programmer authoring surface, six candidate interaction models with a shortlist of two, the eight-brief challenge-graphic set every candidate is proven against, and the round-2 protocol with its evidence gate. Mockups in `docs/design/behaviour-authoring/`. |
| `JOB_RUNNER_PLAN.md` | One queue per machine for browser-driving work and merges. Steps 1, 3 and 5 BUILT (2026-08-25); step 2 revised on contact; step 4 not started. The queue IS the merge lock. |
| `ORCHESTRATION_NEXT.md` | RATIFIED 2026-09-01 with corrections: the master stays `opus high` and Opus is also a major worker pool; Fable consults; both Antigravity pools exploited, Codex availability-routed; verification layers by risk; a ledger routes delegation. Three phases, evidence-gated. |
| `ORCHESTRATION_REVIEW.md` | The 2026-09-02 fresh-eyes review of the modular orchestrator: the Phase A verdict written before any edit (the common path is ~590 lines, not 170; four more cached facts), the comparison against Pocock's agent-writing principles, and the before/after behavioural evaluation. |
| `CATALOG_EXPANSION_PLAN.md` | The 2026-07-30 executive decision: the catalog does not primarily need more lower thirds, it needs coverage of complete production packages. |
| `AI_LITE_BRAND_PLAN.md` | Lite brand graphics - beat free templates or ship nothing. Its own §2 value gate FAILED on the owner's blind ballot (2026-08-14); REVIVED by owner decision 2026-08-15 with a re-run of that same gate as the bar. |
| `VERCEL_PRO_NO_OVERAGE_PLAN.md` | The operating plan for using the Pro subscription fully while keeping the bill at the fixed platform fee. Review on a Vercel pricing change or before enabling another paid service. |
| `IBC_LISTING_CHECKLIST.md` | Getting NoaCG listed in the OGraf ecosystem, for one ~45-minute sitting. Everything a machine could check is checked; what remains is the owner's half. |
| `NORTH_STAR_2027.md` | RATIFIED 2026-09-01 with amendments: the one-year north star, eight programmes with customer-facing acceptance claims, and the claim-maturity evidence model (implemented -> machine-verified -> scenario-proven -> owner-accepted -> production-proven). §9 records the rulings; the LIVE programme state is `PROGRAMMES.md`. |
| `CATALOG_LAZY_LOADING_PLAN.md` | **Design note only, nothing built.** The catalog is eagerly loaded for every visitor: `/app` boots 802 script modules in dev, 520 of them `src/templates`. **Production measured 2026-07-31: 1 171 KB transferred, 1 612 ms to a usable editor** — the "4.16 MB" in the first draft was the DECODED chunk, not the wire, and the note now says so. The stage-1 audit found the blocker is two declared values per variant, so the fix is small; the measurement says it is also **not urgent**, and the one reading that could change that (real mobile hardware) has never been taken. Two questions open for the owner: when, and category-vs-pack. |

## Rationale / historical (do not read as current behaviour)

| Doc | What it explains |
|---|---|
| `GOALS_ARCHIVE.md` | Every milestone that shipped up to 2026-08-07, with its date and rationale, plus the ratified decisions behind them. The live roadmap is `GOALS.md`. |
| `OWNER_RULINGS.md` | The dated log of rulings the owner gave in session, moved out of the memory store on 2026-09-03. Read it as EVIDENCE, not authority: several predate the landing queue and the student-release pivot, `GOALS.md` outranks all of it, and the precedence order is in `MISTAKE_TRIGGERS.md`. |
| `ERA5_PLAN.md` | Why the server era is shaped as it is (Supabase, AGPL split, offline invariance). Shipped through 5.6; 5.7 payments open. |
| `TIMELINE_PLAN.md` | The pre-v2 timeline direction + the Loopic/SPX competitive research. Superseded by Timeline v2. |
| `WYSIWYG_PLAN.md` | The first canvas-editing slices and their guardrails. Shipped and extended. |
| `TIMELINE_V2_PLAN.md` | The declarative-timeline rewrite: the audit, the twelve decisions, the category migration story. Complete. |
| `DYNAMIC_MOTION_SCOPE.md` | Why measured motion is a named-builder primitive (`dynamics`) and not an expression language. Shipped. |
| `PRESET_MODEL_REVIEW.md` | The keyframe model's expressive range: which gaps closed (most) and which stay open by choice (stagger knob, springs, per-property duration, motion paths). |
| `THEME_DEFAULTS_REVIEW.md` | The family-token audit behind the applied 2026-07-21 defaults. Open remnant: the `labelColor` / `displayTracking` re-modelling questions. |
| `HYPERFRAMES_QUALITY.md` | Video-engine bench measurements + the corpus. Note its own header: measurements are dated records, not promises. |
| `BROADCAST_DESIGN_SYSTEM_RESEARCH.md` | The skills evaluation + reference-library architecture. Shipped on `SELECTION_MODE='legacy'` with the 14-card pool; contrast selection measured and rejected. |
| `noacg-master-goals.md` | The five-phase template-library / state-machine / control-layer master plan. **All five phases complete** (2026-07-19 → 2026-07-21). §1.4's acceptance criteria remain the model's standing tests. |
| `AI_ATTEMPTS.md` | THE GRAVEYARD: one entry per AI approach this repo paid to learn about and then stopped using, so an abandoned approach is not mistaken for current strategy or re-proposed from scratch. |
| `AI_PLATFORM_PLAN.md` | PARKED 2026-08-08, superseded by `src/ai/AGENTS.md`, `AI_PROVIDER_GATEWAY.md` and `AI_TASK_REGISTRY.md`. The stages it proposed are built and owned elsewhere; kept for the ratified reasoning. |
| `CREATIVE_MODE_PLAN.md` | RETIRED 2026-08-09 by owner decision, superseded by NoaCG Pro. A record to MINE, not a plan to continue - Creative Mode is no longer carried as a parallel architecture. |
| `PRO_PHASE1_HANDOFF.md` | The handoff out of the Pro Phase 0 spike (2026-08-12) into the brand round, written so the next session did not have to reconstruct it from a transcript. Nothing from that branch was merged. |
| `FIGHT_NIGHT_PACK_PLAN.md` | BUILT 2026-08-17, and since UNIFIED onto the graphics-pack system (`GRAPHICS_PACKS.md`). Kept for the §9 defaults and the vision check the owner approved. |
| `TEMPLATE_TAXONOMY_PROPOSAL.md` | ADOPTED & IMPLEMENTED: the facet registries, declared meta and derivation behind the Browse storefront. All six §18 decisions accepted; §17 stages 1-5 shipped. |
| `TEMPLATE_CATALOG_AUDIT.md` | The July 2026 catalog audit over 387 entries. §6 items 1 and 2 (the type floor, the automated gate) are done; every other finding still stands as written. |
| `LOWER_THIRDS_REFERENCE_CORPUS.md` | Research notes on the ~170 MB commercial reference set (two showreels, eight Premiere templates, forty alpha shape elements). The corpus itself is not in the repo. |
| `SPX_EXAMPLES_CORPUS.md` | Research notes on `spx_examples/` - ~1.3 GB of real SPX productions from Yle and Finnish orchestras. Gitignored, never committed; this is what reading it taught. |
| `MODEL_VS_HARNESS_STUDY.md` | The blind four-arm gallery that separates "our checkpoint is too weak" from "our harness selects for plainness" - the experiment `LOWER_THIRDS_REFERENCE_CORPUS.md` §7 designed. Spends real money. |
| `VIDEO_MODEL_BENCHMARK.md` | How video models are benchmarked as TRANSPORTS rather than separate generators: every selected model enters the existing harness and produces the same Motion Director plan. |
| `CONTROL_PANEL_RESEARCH.md` | Measured 2026-08-30: what competing tools let a user do between a drawing and a control panel, and which of those capabilities OGraf obliges us to keep. Names the owner's capability bar; authorizes nothing. |
| `OGRAF_ECOSYSTEM.md` | Research dossier, 2026-08-29, extending `OGRAF_FIRST_REVIEW.md`: a verdict per open-source project in the ecosystem, and the interop boundaries. **Nothing here authorizes implementation.** |
| `STUDENT_RELEASE_ACCEPTANCE.md` | The owner acceptance checklist of the CLOSED student release (`GOALS_ARCHIVE.md`). The agent-automatable half is done and named, so nothing a spec already pins is re-tested by hand; the rest needs real hardware. |

## Untracked companions (primary checkout only)

- `live_format_graphics_needs.xlsx` (repo root) — the 60-format source data behind
  `PACK_TAXONOMY.md` and the type frequencies.

## The shelf

- `backlog/` - the shelf: one file per unscheduled idea, a mandatory `## Why`, graduate-into-GOALS-or-die, and the drain order that puts it LAST behind owner feedback, handoffs and the current push. Its own `README.md` is the contract.

## Where the roadmap lives

`GOALS.md` is the ONE roadmap — never duplicate it into a second file. It holds only what is
**not done**, inside the ~200-line budget its own opening paragraph states, so it can be read in
one sitting. When a goal lands, move its entry verbatim into `GOALS_ARCHIVE.md` (the complete
shipped record, with dates and rationale) and delete it from `GOALS.md`. When the direction
changes, rewrite `GOALS.md`; the archive keeps the history. Plans get their own doc only while
they need design rationale; when they finish, they move to the historical table above.

Two files sit beside it without duplicating it (ratified 2026-09-01): `NORTH_STAR_2027.md` is the
one-year vision, claims and evidence model - direction, not a work list; `PROGRAMMES.md` is the
authorization register - which long-running programmes the orchestrator may advance, and their
state. The roadmap says what the push is; the register says what else is legal to work on.
