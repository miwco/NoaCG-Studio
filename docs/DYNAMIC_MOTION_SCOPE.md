# Dynamic (measured) motion — scope for migrating tickers & credits

This is the design scope for the one gap that keeps **tickers** and **end credits** on the legacy
patchers (and therefore blocks Phase 8 of `docs/TIMELINE_V2_PLAN.md`). It is the follow-up the
loop/yoyo work named: loop/yoyo unblocked starting-soon, but explicitly **not** tickers/credits,
because their motion is computed from live DOM measurement, which the static keyframe model
deliberately cannot express (`docs/PRESET_MODEL_REVIEW.md` gap 6, and gap 3's spirit).

Status: **BUILT AND SHIPPED.** The `dynamics` primitive is in the model, the interpreter, the
importer, validation, and the timeline; tickers and end credits create as data blocks on it. The
open questions in §8 are ratified below. This document is now the *rationale* record — the
binding contracts live in `src/blocks/CLAUDE.md` (the engine) and `src/templates/CLAUDE.md` (the
category runtimes).

**The one design change from the sketch below:** the region does not need a new "reference a
builder" syntax invented for it, because the preset emits an ordinary `tl.add(builderName(target))`
and the *legacy* reader was taught to see it. That single move keeps ONE choreography source (the
preset emitter) and means measured motion rides the existing importer exactly as `tl.call` hooks
already do — no second code path, and the parity harness compares data against the real legacy emit.

## 1. What these categories actually need (from the code)

The five loop presets (`src/templates/tickers/tickerPresets.ts`,
`src/templates/endCredits/creditsPresets.ts`) split into two hard requirements:

**a) Measured scalar values** — a keyframe value and/or a tween duration derived from a live DOM
measurement, not a literal:

- `ticker-marquee`: `oneSet = track.scrollWidth / 2; x → -oneSet; duration = oneSet / (140 * speed)`, `repeat: -1`.
- `credits-roll`: `endY = -(track.scrollHeight - box.clientHeight/2 - endBlock.offsetHeight/2); duration = (startY - endY) / (90 * speed)`.
- `credits-crawl`: `endX = -(track.scrollWidth - box.clientWidth); duration = distance / (160 * speed)`.

The magnitudes change with the operator's text, so **no static keyframe number can hold them** —
baking a measured pixel value into the data would be wrong the moment the content changes.

**b) Content-driven sequences** — the *number* of animation segments equals the number of DOM
children at runtime:

- `ticker-flip`: `gsap.timeline({repeat:-1})` with one flip-in / hold / flip-out per `.ticker-item`.
- `credits-pages`: one fade-in per `.credits-page`, with a per-page hold derived from the page's row count.

No fixed-length keyframe track can represent "one segment per child."

## 2. Approaches considered and why they lose

- **Measured-value keyframes** (a keyframe whose `value`/`time` is a `{ measure: el, of: "scrollWidth" }`
  descriptor the interpreter resolves at play time). Handles (a)'s simplest case, but credits-roll's
  three-measurement arithmetic needs a real expression, and it cannot express (b) at all (dynamic
  segment count). Two shapes to cover the five presets.
- **A restricted formula grammar** (named measurements + a safe `+ - * / ()` evaluator over them).
  Covers (a) including the arithmetic, still cannot express (b), and it introduces a mini-language —
  against the house rule of simple, obvious code, and adjacent to the no-`eval` posture the community
  bench guards.
- **Keep them fully hand-crafted (status quo).** They then never get the data-block surface, so the
  classic strip and legacy patchers can never be retired for them — Phase 8 stays blocked.

## 3. The proposed primitive: named dynamic motion segments

Mirror the §3b step-calls model exactly, but for **motion** instead of side effects. A step gains an
optional `dynamics` list; each entry names a **design-owned builder function** (a bare identifier,
resolved by `window[name]` at build time — no `eval`, no arguments-as-code) that **returns a GSAP
tween/timeline**, which the interpreter adds to the step timeline:

```json
{ "name": "Enter", "duration": 0.5, "ease": "power2.out",
  "dynamics": [ { "build": "marqueeLoop", "target": "#ticker-track", "time": 0.5 } ],
  "layers": { ".ticker-box": { "opacity": [ { "time": 0, "value": 0 }, { "time": 0.5, "value": 1 } ] } }
}
```

- `build` — a global function defined in the template's **own JS, OUTSIDE the marked region** (a
  design-owned runtime, exactly like the countdown clock engine `shared/clock.ts` that game-timers
  and starting-soon already ship). It reads the DOM, does whatever arithmetic it needs in plain
  readable JS, and returns a GSAP object (or `null`).
- `target` — an optional selector passed to the builder, so one builder can serve many targets.
- `time` — optional placement on the step's clock (the marquee starts after the entrance fade).
- Schema key order on the step becomes `name, duration, ease, reveals, hides, calls, dynamics, loops, layers`.

### Interpreter (additive to `animRuntime.ts`)

```js
// Dynamic motion: a design-owned builder measures the DOM and returns a GSAP tween/timeline
// (a marquee's width-derived travel, a credits roll). Resolved by name at build time — the
// timeline never owns this logic. A missing builder is a silent no-op.
for (var d = 0; d < (step.dynamics || []).length; d++) {
  (function (name, target, at) {
    var fn = window[name];
    if (typeof fn !== 'function') return;
    var seg = fn(target, { speed: speed });
    if (seg) tl.add(seg, (at || 0) / speed);
  })(step.dynamics[d].build, step.dynamics[d].target, step.dynamics[d].time);
}
```

### The design-owned builder (outside the region, ships in every export)

```js
// The marquee travel — measured at play() time. The track holds the items twice, so sliding
// exactly one set (-scrollWidth/2) and repeating looks seamless. Edit the speed here.
function marqueeLoop(target) {
  var el = document.querySelector(target);
  var oneSet = el.scrollWidth / 2;
  var pxPerSec = 140 * motionSpeed();        // motionSpeed(): NOACG_ANIM.speed, else 1
  return gsap.fromTo(el, { x: 0 },
    { x: -oneSet, duration: oneSet / pxPerSec, ease: 'none', repeat: -1 });
}
```

credits-roll's three-measurement formula and ticker-flip's/credits-pages' per-child sequences are
just ordinary JS inside their builders — the same code they are today, lifted out of `buildInTimeline`
into a named function the data references.

## 4. Why this is the right shape

- **It fits every one of the five presets uniformly** — measured scalars and content-driven
  sequences both reduce to "a builder returns a timeline," where two other approaches each cover only
  part.
- **It is the smallest possible addition** — one optional step field, ~7 interpreter lines, a direct
  copy of the ratified §3b calls pattern (`{ call }` side effects → `{ build }` motion).
- **It honors every pillar.** No `eval` (a `window[name]` lookup). Code is real and the source of
  truth — the measured logic stays readable JS where it belongs. The visual timeline **correctly
  steps aside** for a track it cannot meaningfully keyframe (you cannot visually keyframe "travel by
  measured width"); it renders the segment read-only ("measured motion — `marqueeLoop()` — edit in
  code"), which is honest, not a limitation. Preview/export parity is structural (the builder ships
  verbatim, one implementation). Offline-first is untouched.
- **It unblocks Phase 8 for these categories** — they gain the NOACG_ANIM data-block shape (static
  entrance/exit as keyframes + a dynamic segment for the travel), so they render on `StepTimeline` and
  no longer need the classic strip.

## 5. How each preset maps

As built (the builders live in `src/templates/tickers/tickerMotion.ts` and
`src/templates/endCredits/creditsMotion.ts`):

| Preset | Static (keyframes) | Dynamic segment (builder) |
|---|---|---|
| ticker-marquee | `.ticker-box` opacity fade in/out | `tickerMarquee('#ticker-track')` — measured, `repeat:-1` |
| ticker-flip | box fade | `tickerFlipCycle('#ticker-track')` — per-item `timeline({repeat:-1})` |
| credits-roll | box fade | `creditsRoll('#credits-track')` — three-measurement linear travel |
| credits-crawl | box fade | `creditsCrawl('#credits-track')` — measured horizontal travel |
| credits-pages | box set | `creditsPages('#credits-track')` — per-page fade/hold sequence |

## 6. Validation & timeline UI

- **Validation** (`validateTemplate.ts`): `build` is a bare identifier and the named function is
  defined in `template.js` (warning if missing — same spirit as the dangling-selector and undefined-
  call checks); `target`, when present, should match an element.
- **Timeline** (`StepTimeline.tsx`): a read-only "measured motion" row per target, naming the
  builder, open-ended, with a tooltip that it is edited in code. The §3b calls glyph (a `lifecycle`
  row of named pins) and the `loops` repeat tail shipped alongside it, on the same principle: the
  timeline surfaces every code-owned thing in the data so it never silently hides motion, and makes
  none of them draggable so it never implies an affordance it doesn't have. See
  src/components/CLAUDE.md, "the three read-only surfaces".

## 7. Migration path

- **Catalog templates are regenerated** — the ticker/credits presets emit the new shape directly
  (data block + dynamic segment + the design-owned builder, emitted before the region like the clock
  engine). We own these; no importer round-trip is needed for them.
- **Preset swap for dynamic categories** — swapping marquee↔flip is swapping the builder reference and
  regenerating, not a keyframe edit. `presetApply` (or a category-specific regenerate path) must learn
  to carry a dynamic segment. **Open question** (§8).

## 8. The open questions — RATIFIED

1. **Saved / community / AI legacy tickers → keep a READ-ONLY legacy renderer.** The importer can
   carry a *named* builder across; it cannot lift arbitrary measured JS out of somebody's
   hand-written `buildInTimeline`, and it never guesses. So a saved ticker that inlines its own
   `scrollWidth` math is **refused honestly** and stays legacy.
   **Decision:** Phase 8 retires the classic strip's *editing* patchers (timelineModel's
   `splitTween` / `patchTweenTiming` / … — the bulk of the code) but **keeps a minimal read-only
   view**, so such a template still renders truthfully on the timeline. Converting stays an
   explicit, undoable user action. Auto-regenerating was rejected: it would silently discard
   hand-tuning, which "code is the single source of truth" forbids. Pinned by the refusal test in
   `e2e/anim-engine.spec.ts`.
2. **Preset swap → a pure data edit.** Every builder for a category ships in every template of it
   (a ticker carries both `tickerMarquee` and `tickerFlipCycle`), so swapping the preset swaps the
   `dynamics` entry's `build` name and nothing outside the marked region is touched — which the
   marker contract requires. `presetApply` carries `dynamics` on a whole-graphic swap exactly as it
   already carries `calls`; per-layer applies never touch either, because both are step-level.
   The cost is one or two unused (but commented, and callable) builders in an export — a fair price
   for a swap that stays a one-line data change, and arguably a feature: the template ships its
   category's small motion library.
3. **Speed knob stays in the builder** (code-owned), read through `motionSpeed()`. Unchanged from
   the sketch; surfacing it as a Style knob remains a possible later enhancement.
4. **Builder naming: bare globals, category-prefixed** (`tickerMarquee`, `creditsRoll`) rather than
   a namespace object. The prefix is what avoids collisions across composed packets, and a bare
   function keeps the `window[name]` lookup — and the generated code — as plain as everything else
   in a template.

## 9. Explicitly NOT in this primitive

No expression language, no measured-value keyframe type, no arbitrary JS in the data (the data holds a
name and a target — the logic stays in code), no visual editing of measured travel, no attempt to make
the importer auto-convert arbitrary hand-written measured motion.

## 10. What shipped

The `dynamics` primitive as the direct §3b twin — schema, interpreter, importer, validation, and the
read-only timeline block — with tickers and end credits created onto it, and a parity harness that
compares each measured preset against its legacy emit at sampled times across short and long content
(`e2e/anim-engine.spec.ts`).

Where it landed differently from the sketch: the region references its builder with an ordinary
`tl.add(builderName(target))` and the legacy reader parses that, so there is exactly ONE choreography
source (the preset emitter) and the measured motion rides the existing importer the same way `tl.call`
hooks do. That also made the preset swap fall out for free as a pure data edit (§8.2).

**What it unblocks:** tickers and credits are off the legacy patchers — and then INFOGRAPHICS, which
turned out to be the purest case of all: every one of their motions is measured (the stat counts to
the operator's figure, each bar grows to its own `data-value`, the ring draws to that percent, the
cascade runs one row per line they wrote), so all four presets became a keyframed panel entrance plus
one named builder (`igMotion.ts`). Two things the infographic pass taught, both now in
src/templates/CLAUDE.md: a builder may COMPOSE another (count-up adds the bar growth once the figure
lands), and a `tl.add()` needs an EXPLICIT position whenever a phase has more than one — a segment is
zero-advance on the importer's clock but a real child on GSAP's, so a bare `'-=N'` after one resolves
differently in the two.

The quiz then flipped on §3b calls (`docs/TIMELINE_V2_PLAN.md` §3c), and INFO CARDS last of all —
so **every category now creates as a data block and the migration is complete**.

**Phase 8 then shipped (2026-07-15), and §8.1 held exactly as ratified**: the strip's *editing*
patchers are deleted, and a read-only renderer stayed — `components/LegacyTimeline.tsx` — for the
templates this document is about. A hand-written measured region is precisely the thing that can
never be auto-converted, so it is the ONE case that still needs the classic chart; an importable
legacy region gets the step timeline read-only instead, with "use keyframes" one click away.
