# Video & image rendering

How NoaCG Studio turns a graphic into finished media (MP4 / WebM / PNG still /
PNG sequence ZIP / ProRes 4444 MOV). The user flow: open a graphic → Export tab →
**Video & image** → pick format + total duration → Render → real progress → Download.

## Three document kinds, one service

The manifest (version 2) is a discriminated union on `kind`:

- **`kind: 'html'`** — the classic path: an SPX/HTML graphic rendered as a self-contained
  document driven by the virtual clock (everything below).
- **`kind: 'remotion'`** — an authored composition from the AI video editor: ONE module
  compiled in-browser (sucrase → CJS, imports limited to react/remotion), its input props
  (assets as data URLs), and a fixed `durationInFrames`. The worker's composition
  `noacg-user` evaluates it under a require shim that supplies the worker's own React and
  Remotion — the exact same shim contract as the live preview's player host, so the
  preview and the render run identical code. No timing model, no schedule, no
  measurement. Composition errors fail the job with the real message (cancelRender). The
  UI side is `src/render/buildVideoManifest.ts` + `VideoRenderPanel`.
- **`kind: 'hyperframes'`** — the video editor's HyperFrames engine: the COMPOSED
  self-contained composition document (`src/video/hyperframes/compose.ts` in 'render'
  mode: assets and GSAP inlined, the NoaCG driver injected) and a fixed
  `durationInFrames`. The worker's composition `noacg-hyperframes` hosts it in a srcdoc
  iframe and drives the driver's `__noacgHfRender` one seek per output frame — the
  NoaCGGraphic pattern minus the schedule/measurement machinery, since a HyperFrames
  composition renders any time t deterministically (clip windows + one paused GSAP
  timeline). Handshakes on `HYPERFRAMES_RUNTIME_VERSION`. Same UI side as 'remotion'.

Tiers, quotas, format rules, executors, and the job store are kind-agnostic and identical
for all three.

## Architecture (NoaCG stays the source of truth)

No graphic is ever recreated as a Remotion composition and no GSAP animation is
rewritten. One generic, deterministic path serves every graphic:

```
SpxTemplate + Data panel values                       (the editor, source of truth)
  → composeRenderDocument()      src/render — a fully self-contained HTML document:
                                 virtual-clock runtime + GSAP + CSS (fonts inlined as
                                 data URLs) + template JS; live polling blocks stripped
  → RenderManifest               src/render/manifest.ts — the versioned job contract:
                                 kind:'html' — document + w/h/fps/scale + timing + data
                                 + format (kind:'remotion' carries compiledJs +
                                 inputProps + durationInFrames instead)
  → NoaCGGraphic composition     render-worker/remotion — ONE composition hosting the
                                 document in a srcdoc iframe, seeking its virtual clock
                                 to frame/fps under Remotion's delayRender protocol
                                 (kind:'remotion' selects UserComposition instead)
  → executor                     api/_lib/executor.ts — LocalExecutor (dev/self-host:
                                 child process) | SandboxExecutor (hosted: Vercel Sandbox
                                 via @remotion/vercel, output to Vercel Blob)
  → download                     token-gated local file route, or the Blob URL
```

### Determinism: the virtual clock

**manifest + frame number = exact pixels.** The render document virtualizes `Date`,
`performance.now`, `setTimeout`/`setInterval`, and `requestAnimationFrame`, detaches
GSAP's rAF ticker, and drives `gsap.updateRoot(t)` in frame quanta while executing the
graphic's REAL cue lifecycle (`update → play → next× → stop`) as virtual timers
(src/render/runtimeScript.ts). Because the real code runs — only against our clock —
countdowns, `tl.call` clocks, count-up `onUpdate` callbacks, and `repeat:-1` marquees
all render exactly as they play live, reproducibly. Verified: two renders of the same
manifest are byte-identical, and a 3:00 countdown reads 2:59 at t=2 s and 2:53 at t=8 s
in the finished MP4.

Determinism is promised **per environment** (same machine / same sandbox image); OS
font rasterizers may differ sub-pixel across platforms. Wall-clock graphics (the corner
bug's live clock) read the manifest's `epochMs`, so they render a fixed, reproducible
time — by design.

### Total duration and HOLD (src/render/schedule.ts)

The user picks the TOTAL duration; animations keep their real durations, measured
in-page at final resolution (`__noacgRender.prepare()` builds each phase once, reads
`duration()`, kills it, resets — so layout-sized phases like credit rolls and ticker
marquees are correct by construction). The remainder becomes HOLD, split **equally**
across the slots after IN and after each played step — never after OUT, which ends the
render exactly on the total. Endless loops (`repeat:-1`) count as continuous with fixed
cost 0. A total shorter than the fixed animation time is a hard error carrying the
measured numbers, raised in the UI preflight AND by the renderer.

### Formats (official Remotion codec settings)

| Format | Codec | Alpha | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| MP4 | h264, yuv420p | no | flattened onto a chosen background color |
| WebM | vp8 (vp9 opt-in) + yuva420p | yes | alpha plays in Chrome/Firefox, not Safari |
| PNG still | renderStill | yes | defaults to the settled on-air moment |
| PNG sequence | renderFrames → `frame-00000.png` zip | yes | zero-padded, STORE zip |
| ProRes 4444 MOV | prores '4444' + yuva444p10le | yes | the NLE path |

All video renders capture PNG frames (broadcast gradients band under JPEG capture).
Output size = template resolution × the scale option — the document itself is never
resized (layout math depends on the authored resolution).

## Service (api/render/*)

`start` passes the burst gate below, validates the manifest against the caller's tier,
enforces quotas (duplicate-submit first — it answers the already-running job id — then
concurrency, then hourly/daily windows), stores sha256 hashes of two per-job secrets (the
browser's status/cancel token; the worker's completion secret), passes the fleet ceiling
below, and launches the executor.
Sandbox launches run under `waitUntil` AFTER the 202 — no request waits on VM
provisioning. `status` reconciles executor progress into the job, finalizes completion,
and fails lost jobs past their deadline. `cancel` stops the executor. `complete` is the
worker-secret callback. `cleanup` (cron, CRON_SECRET) sweeps expired outputs and stale
jobs.

Job ledger: `render_jobs` in Supabase (migration 0007) when a Supabase secret key is set —
`SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` (the new `sb_secret_…` key, preferred) or the legacy service_role JWT
in `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (fallback). The key is only ever handed to `createClient` as
an opaque API key with RLS-bypassing access, so either format works. Otherwise the ledger
lives in process memory (dev/self-host).

### Tiers & limits (src/render/limits.ts — every number lives there)

| | anonymous | free (signed in) | paid (defined, not yet reachable) |
|---|---|---|---|
| formats | mp4, webm, png-still | + png-sequence, prores4444 | all |
| max output / fps | 1920×1080 / 30 | 1920×1080 / 60 | 4096×2304 / 60 |
| max duration | 15 s | 60 s (prores/seq 30 s) | 300 s |
| concurrent / hour / day | 1 / 2 / 6 | 2 / 10 / 40 | 4 / 30 / 150 |

Client checks are UX; the server re-validates everything. Introducing a paid tier =
changing `resolveTier()` to read an entitlements source; nothing else moves.

### Flood protection: three layers, three different jobs

The tier table is the per-visitor **entitlement**, and it is checked only after a request
has been fully parsed. Three separate guards sit in front of it, and they are not
substitutes for each other:

| layer | where | stops |
|---|---|---|
| WAF rate-limit rule | Vercel edge, before any function runs | a flood, at zero cost |
| burst gate | `api/_lib/rateLimit.ts`, first line of `start` | one hammering client, before the body read |
| fleet ceiling | `api/_lib/admission.ts`, after the ledger insert | too many renders RUNNING at once |

### The burst gate (api/_lib/rateLimit.ts)

Refuses **429 `rate_limited`** with `Retry-After` before `start` reads a body of up to
4 MB, verifies auth, or touches the ledger — everything below that line is real work done
on the caller's behalf.

| | default | env override |
|---|---|---|
| window | 60 s | `RENDER_START_RATE_WINDOW_SEC` |
| starts per window per client IP | 60 (0 disables) | `RENDER_START_RATE_MAX` |

The limit is deliberately far above legitimate use — a signed-in user may only start 10
renders an *hour*. It is keyed on the salted IP hash, and this product's users sit behind
shared addresses: a university lab or a station gallery is one NAT IP, so the gate has to
clear a whole room pressing Render at once. It is a flood gate, not a quota.

Counting is **in process, therefore per instance** — no Redis, no extra round trip,
nothing to configure when self-hosting. Fluid Compute reuses instances, so a hammering
client keeps meeting the same counter, but N instances mean an effective ceiling up to N×.
That is the accepted shape: this layer exists to make abuse *cheap to refuse*, the
globally-exact limit is the WAF rule, and the guarantee that actually bounds spend is the
fleet ceiling. The window is a sliding one approximated by two fixed windows (the previous
window's count decays as the current fills), which costs O(1) memory per client and
denies the 2×-across-the-boundary burst a plain fixed window would allow.

### The WAF rate-limit rule (Vercel, not in this repo)

The only layer that refuses a flood *before a function is invoked* — Vercel does not bill
for requests blocked by a WAF rule. It lives in project config, so it covers the hosted
deployment only; the two in-repo layers are what a self-hosted install gets. Staged as a
draft by `rules add`, and **published by a human** — a bad condition on this route is an
outage:

```bash
npx vercel link
npx vercel firewall rules add "Rate limit render starts" \
  --condition '{"type":"path","op":"eq","value":"/api/render/start"}' \
  --condition '{"type":"method","op":"eq","value":"POST"}' \
  --action rate_limit \
  --rate-limit-window 60 \
  --rate-limit-requests 120 \
  --rate-limit-keys ip \
  --rate-limit-action log \
  --yes
```

Note `--rate-limit-action log`: land it in log mode, read
`https://vercel.com/<team>/<project>/firewall/traffic?filter=<ruleId>` for a day to
confirm only abuse is matching, and only then edit it to `deny`. Scope it to
`/api/render/start` and POST — never the whole `/api` prefix, which would also throttle
the 2.5 s status poll every running job makes. Two caveats worth knowing before tightening:
WAF counters are **per region**, so N regions can collectively pass ~N× the configured
number; and the same NAT reasoning above applies, which is why 120/min sits above the
in-repo gate rather than under it (the edge rule is the coarse net, the gate is the
precise one).

### The fleet ceiling (api/_lib/admission.ts)

Every number in the table above is **per principal**. None of them bounds a traffic
spike: 300 visitors each starting one legal render satisfy every tier cap and produce 300
simultaneous 4-vCPU microVMs. The anonymous principal is a salted IP hash, so a
rotating-IP flood clears the per-principal caps too. So the deployment gets its own
ceiling, on top of the tier quotas:

| | default | env override |
|---|---|---|
| simultaneous jobs, all principals | 12 | `RENDER_MAX_CONCURRENT` |
| ceiling above which ANONYMOUS starts are refused | 8 | `RENDER_ANONYMOUS_MAX_CONCURRENT` |
| `Retry-After` on the refusal | 60 s | `RENDER_BUSY_RETRY_AFTER_SEC` |

Defaults live with every other render number (`RENDER_CONFIG.globalConcurrency`); the env
reads live in `admission.ts` because limits.ts is pure and also runs in the browser.
The anonymous ceiling is the graceful-degradation step: a spike squeezes anonymous
visitors first, so signed-in users keep rendering. Setting `RENDER_MAX_CONCURRENT=0`
closes the render service without a deploy. A refusal is **503 `busy`** with `Retry-After`;
the Export UI shows the server message inline and leaves the button armed.

Admission runs **after** the job row is inserted, and the row is deleted again on refusal.
That ordering is load-bearing: counting before the insert lets a stampede of simultaneous
requests all read the same pre-spike count and all pass — exactly the case the ceiling
exists for. Inserting first makes concurrent requests visible to each other, at the price
of possible over-rejection right at the boundary (the safe direction for a cost guard).
Deleting keeps a refusal from consuming the caller's hourly/daily window, which counts
rows by `created_at` regardless of state. Stuck rows can't wedge the ceiling: `deadlineAt`
plus the cleanup cron sweep non-terminal jobs.

## Security posture

Rendered documents contain user-authored HTML/CSS/JS — treated as untrusted code:

- Hosted renders run in **Vercel Sandbox** (Firecracker microVM), destroyed per job.
  User JS executes in the sandbox's Chrome page, never in our functions.
- The render document needs **zero network** (assets + fonts ride as data URLs) and its
  runtime stubs `fetch`/`XHR`/`WebSocket`/`BroadcastChannel` to inert no-ops; the marked
  LIVE DATA / SHOW CHAT / REMOTE CONTROL blocks are stripped before rendering.
- Job identity is two independent secrets (browser token / worker secret), stored only
  as sha256; wrong tokens get the same 404 as missing jobs. Anonymous quotas key on a
  salted IP hash — raw IPs are never stored.
- Runaway protection: per-frame Remotion timeouts, a per-job sandbox wall clock derived
  from frames×resolution (RENDER_CONFIG), a timer-fire cap inside the virtual clock,
  and the cleanup cron as backstop. Output size is capped per tier.
- Finished files live at unguessable `renders/<jobId>/…` Blob paths with a short TTL
  (anonymous 2 h, free 24 h). Public-read-by-URL is a deliberate v1 tradeoff — the
  4.5 MB function response cap rules out proxied downloads. **The Blob store must be
  configured for public access** (the worker uploads with `access: 'public'`); a private
  store rejects the upload. Switching to private + token-gated signed downloads (via
  `@vercel/blob`'s `issueSignedToken`/`presignUrl`, redirected through a jobToken-gated
  endpoint) is the documented next step and would be isolated to the worker + the file route.
- **kind:'remotion' specifics:** the authored module executes in the render PAGE itself
  (not a stubbed srcdoc iframe) — the microVM / self-host machine remains the security
  boundary, and no secrets exist in the page (`BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` lives in the
  worker's Node process env, never in Chrome). The page's network is deliberately NOT
  stubbed: Remotion's own machinery (OffthreadVideo frame extraction, delayRender asset
  loading) shares the page and needs fetch. Determinism guardrails live in the editor's
  static validator (imports limited to react/remotion, no fetch/XHR/network URLs, no
  wall clocks or Math.random in user SOURCE); a hostile client can skip the validator,
  which is exactly why the boundary is the sandbox, not the validator. Worst case, a
  malicious module corrupts or hangs its own render — bounded by the per-frame and
  per-job timeouts.
- Remaining hardening candidates: a pathname-scoped Blob token instead of the RW token
  in the sandbox env (blocked on @remotion/vercel's upload accepting client tokens) and
  a deny-by-default sandbox network policy phase-switched after provisioning — which
  would cover BOTH kinds' remaining network surface.
- **Asset budget (kind:'remotion'):** assets travel as data URLs inside the manifest,
  which is capped at 4 MB (Vercel body limit) — roughly 2.5–3 MB of raw media. The
  editor enforces a 3 MB per-asset cap at upload and the export panel shows a budget
  meter naming the largest assets. The documented follow-up for bigger media: a
  client→Blob upload channel with URLs in inputProps and the executor pre-fetching
  assets into the sandbox before render.

## Running it

**Local / self-host (no cloud at all):** set `VITE_RENDER_API=1` in `.env`, run
`npm install` inside `render-worker/` once, start the dev server. The Export tab's
render section appears and renders on your machine (LocalExecutor spawns
`render-worker/job.mjs`; first run downloads Chrome Headless Shell). Verify with
`node scripts/render-smoke.mjs`.

**Hosted (Vercel):**
1. Apply migration `supabase/migrations/0007_render_jobs.sql` to the live database.
2. Create a **public** Blob store (Vercel → Storage → Blob) and connect it to the project
   (the worker uploads `access: 'public'`; a private store rejects the upload).
3. Set the project env vars and redeploy:

```
VITE_RENDER_API=1
RENDER_EXECUTOR=sandbox
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=   (from the Blob store)
SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY=     (new sb_secret_… key; or set SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY instead)
CRON_SECRET=             (any long random string)
IP_HASH_SALT=            (any long random string)
```

The deploy build prebuilds the Remotion bundle (`vercel.json` buildCommand) and ships
it to the functions (includeFiles); sandboxes get it via `addBundleToSandbox` — nothing
of ours is npm-installed inside sandboxes. `@vercel/sandbox` is pinned to the version
`@remotion/vercel` is built against; bump them together only.

Inside the sandbox, **all five formats** render through one worker
(`render-worker/sandbox-job.mjs`, a detached command): it reads the manifest from a file
and calls `@remotion/renderer` programmatically. It does NOT use `@remotion/vercel`'s
`renderMediaOnVercel`, which passes `inputProps` as a single CLI argument — our manifest
embeds the whole self-contained document, so that argument exceeds the OS 128 KB
single-argument limit (`E2BIG`). A file + in-process `inputProps` sidesteps that. The api
handlers import shared `src/render` modules with explicit `.js` extensions because the
deployed functions run as ESM (`type: module`), where Node requires them.

### First-deploy checklist

- [ ] anonymous MP4 1080p25 ≤15 s renders and downloads
- [ ] signed-in ProRes 4444 renders; alpha verified in an NLE
- [ ] signed-in PNG sequence (the hand-rolled zip path in sandbox-job.mjs — least
      field-proven; watch the sandbox logs on the first run)
- [ ] cancel mid-render stops the sandbox (Vercel dashboard shows it gone)
- [ ] third anonymous render within an hour answers 429
- [ ] the cleanup cron log shows expired outputs deleted after TTL
- [ ] sandbox count returns to zero after each job

## Testing

- `npm run test:e2e` — offline suite; includes `render-schedule.spec.ts` (schedule +
  limits math) and `render.spec.ts` (panel states over a stubbed API).
- `node scripts/render-smoke.mjs` — the REAL full loop on this machine, BOTH kinds:
  html manifest from a live catalog template → api → local Remotion render → download +
  MP4 sniff + token probes, then a kind:'remotion' fixture through the same service plus
  a throwing-module job that must fail with a useful message. Not in CI (renders take
  minutes and download Chrome).
- `node scripts/render-smoke-video.mjs` — the CONTENT → RENDER round trip for a video
  project, checked in PIXELS. A video's editable inputs reach the live preview through the
  player host's set-props channel but the render through `inputProps` in the manifest, so a
  working preview proves nothing about the render. This builds the manifest with the app's
  own modules (the calls VideoRenderPanel makes) from a project whose values were edited away
  from their code defaults, renders a png-still for real, and reads the frame back: the
  corner pixel must be the edited accent and the centre pixel the asset an IMAGE input names.
  A dropped field renders the code's own fallback instead — which a container sniff cannot
  see. Not in CI (same reason as above).
- `node scripts/render-smoke-hyperframes.mjs` — the same pixel-checked round trip for the
  'hyperframes' kind: static checks → compose ('render' mode) → api → worker → png-still,
  then reads back a variable value (`var(--accent)`), proof the timeline was actually
  SEEKED (a slab parked over the checked corner is tweened away by mid-frame), and an
  `asset:` reference resolved to the uploaded asset. Not in CI.
- `node scripts/make-render-manifest.mjs <out> <variantId> [sec] [format] [fps] [scale]
  [createOptionsJson]` + `node render-worker/cli.mjs <manifest> <out>` — render any
  catalog variant by hand.
- `node scripts/make-remotion-manifest.mjs <out> [frames] [format] [fps] [scale]` — a
  kind:'remotion' fixture with a hand-written module (no browser needed), for the same
  cli loop.

## License note

Remotion is source-available: free for individuals and organizations up to 3 people,
paid company license above that (https://remotion.dev/license). NoaCG Studio is
currently a solo project, so the free tier applies. The dependency is isolated in
`render-worker/` (its own package) and never enters the AGPL app bundle — as is
`@remotion/player`, which lives only in `player-host/` (its own package, built into
`public/player-host/` as a standalone page the app talks to via postMessage). Revisit
the license if the organization grows past 3 people.
