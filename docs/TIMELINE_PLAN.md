# Timeline & advanced animation — direction plan

The timeline's job: make **complex broadcast animation sequencing controllable and
reusable** — timing, easing, per-line choreography, and next()/step triggers — for people
who will never hand-edit GSAP. It is deliberately NOT the graphics creation surface (the
wizard + panels own creation) and NOT a Loopic-style keyframe composer clone.

## The anchor principle

The marked ANIMATION region is already a deterministic, re-emittable program: presets emit
`buildInTimeline()/buildOutTimeline()` with named knobs (`animSpeed`, `easeIn`, `easeOut`)
and per-phase preset comments the Motion panel can read back (`blocks/animPatch.ts`). The
timeline is a **richer view + richer knobs over that same region** — every timeline gesture
re-emits readable GSAP code between the markers; hand-written code outside them is never
touched. If the timeline can express it, the code shows it; if the code can't show it
readably, the timeline doesn't offer it.

## Phases

### T1 — Read-only timeline view (see the choreography) — ✅ SHIPPED + T1.5 (2026-07-08)
Parse the emitted region (we wrote it, so parsing is by construction, not heuristics) into
tracks: one row per animated element (accent, box, each line mask), bars for start/duration,
ease labels, phase markers (IN · OUT). Scrub pauses the live preview via the simulator.
**T1.5 (user feedback):** the timeline moved OUT of the Motion tab to where animation tools
put it — a collapsible strip directly under the preview, above the transport buttons — with a
**live playhead**: the simulator owns the running timeline (`window.__activeTl`), a rAF loop
follows it, ▶ Play sweeps the In phase, ■ Stop auto-switches to Out and sweeps it, loops wrap.
Idle parks at the end of In (the settled design-view state).

### T2 — Timing knobs on the tracks — ✅ SHIPPED (2026-07-08), simpler than planned
Implemented as **literal patching, not knob emission**: dragging a bar's body (start) or its
right-edge handle (duration) rewrites that tween's literals in the already-emitted region —
`patchTweenTiming` in blocks/timelineModel.ts, the T1 parser in reverse. Durations stay the
readable `N / animSpeed` form; a moved tween gets an explicit absolute position
(`N / animSpeed` — plain GSAP), replacing its '-=' overlap. Zero preset-module changes; the
emitted code keeps its sequential, commented shape; the speed knob still scales everything.
0.05s snap keeps literals two-decimal readable. One undoable applyTemplate per release +
auto-replay so the new timing is heard immediately. set() ticks and measured durations
(marquee width/speed) are non-editable by construction. Preset swaps still re-emit cleanly
(customizations are intentionally preset-scoped). **Per-element eases: deferred to T2.5**
(the easing vocabulary + direction doctrine in model/easings.ts stays the law).

### T3 — Steps & next() sequencing (the live-graphics differentiator) — PLANNED 2026-07-08

**Competitive research (sources: docs.loopic.io API docs, SPX HTML template docs):**
- **Loopic** models multi-phase graphics as ONE keyframe timeline with **Stop actions** (the
  playhead pauses there; the next command resumes toward the following stop) and an **Outro
  action** (the stop command plays from that frame). Intuitive AE-style authoring — but the
  step count is baked into the keyframes, so data-driven graphics (N credit lines, N quiz
  options) can't adapt; and their SPX "Steps" support was still listed as upcoming in their
  LiveOS integration notes.
- **SPX** itself only counts: `steps ≥ 2` shows the operator a **Continue** button; each press
  calls the template's `next()`. What a step DOES is entirely template-defined, and SPX shows
  nothing about what comes next.
- **CasparCG** `next()` = same contract; **H2R** has no next at all; **Singular.Live** uses
  state/payload control, a different paradigm.

**The NoaCG model — segment chain (the synthesis that beats both):** the graphic is a chain
`▶ IN → » Step 2 → » Step 3 → … → ■ OUT`, rendered on the timeline strip as consecutive
segments separated by playout markers — it LOOKS like Loopic's stop-point timeline (instantly
familiar), but each step segment is semantically generated from the fields, so the step count
follows the data and presets stay swappable. The operator-facing truth ("what plays on each
press") is the strip itself.

Slices:
- **T3.1 — Steps on the strip + live playhead.** Emit upgrade: `revealNextStep()` returns its
  tween and reads per-step knobs (see T3.2), and the steps block gains a parseable shape. The
  strip renders segment tabs `In · »2 · »3 · … · Out` with real durations and markers; the
  simulator wraps next() so `__activeTl` covers steps and the playhead sweeps each press.
  Scrubbing a step segment first jumps IN + prior steps to their end (suppressed), then pauses
  the step's tween. The `out` playout setting shows as a badge after OUT ("manual" / auto-ms).
- **T3.2 — Per-step timing/ease knobs.** The emitted steps block declares per-step literals
  (duration/ease per revealed line — same `N / animSpeed` + quoted-ease vocabulary), patched by
  the same literal patcher the T2/T2.5 bars use. Bars inside step segments drag like any other.
- **T3.3 — Reveal groups (the better-than-Loopic move).** Which lines reveal on which press
  stops being fixed one-line-per-step: the emitted block declares
  `var stepGroups = [['#f1'], ['#f2', '#f3']]` (commented, readable), the runtime reveals a
  GROUP per next(), and the strip lets you drag a line's bar from one step segment to another
  to regroup. Data-driven graphics get arbitrary reveal choreography with zero keyframing.

Non-goals: freeform stop-points inside arbitrary hand-written timelines (the code editor is
the escape hatch, as ever); Singular-style state machines. The steps vocabulary stays within
the marked region + the SPX `steps` setting so every export target keeps working.

### T4 — Custom sequences (escape hatch, later)
Add/reorder simple actions per element (move/fade/scale/blur) as new emitted tweens in the
region — still preset-grade readable output with comments. The moment a request needs
free-form keyframes, the answer is the code editor, one click away.

## Non-goals

- No general-purpose keyframe editor, no curves UI beyond the easing vocabulary.
- No timeline-owned state: the region is always the truth; reload from code at any time.
- No new runtime: GSAP timelines as today; `ease: 'none'` stays reserved for continuous
  motion (tickers/credits) per DESIGN_LANGUAGE §4.

## Sequencing vs Era 6

T1 (read-only view) can ship independently and even before WYSIWYG W2+ — it needs no new
code contracts. T2 needs a knob-emit extension per preset (touches every preset module —
plan one mechanical pass). T3 builds on the existing steps machinery. Recommended order:
W1 → T1 → T2 → W2/W3 → T3, re-evaluated against user feedback.
