# HyperFrames generation quality - measurements and what they changed

What real-model benchmarking of the HyperFrames video engine found, what was changed as a
result, and what is still open. Numbers and method are here so the next round compares
against evidence rather than memory.

Model throughout: `claude-sonnet-5` (the bench pins it; director and coder both use it).

## Running the bench

```bash
node scripts/video-bench.mjs <out-dir> [briefs] [runs] --engine=hyperframes
node scripts/video-bench.mjs <out-dir> [briefs] [runs] --engine=hyperframes --stub  # free
```

`--engine` runs the same briefs through either coder; everything downstream (source captured,
frame strip, checks) follows it. **`--stub` runs the whole path on the offline provider for
free** - use it to prove a bench change works before spending anything.

Two environment requirements, both learned the hard way:

- The dev server must **not** have `VITE_SUPABASE_*` set. With a backend configured the
  visitor is signed out and the wizard's video step renders a sign-in prompt instead of the
  controls; the bench now fails with that sentence instead of a bare selector timeout.
- Don't touch `.env` while a bench is in flight - Vite restarts on the change and the
  in-flight generation is lost.

Custom briefs are `{label, prompt, durationSec?, transparent?, assets?: [paths]}`; assets are
really uploaded through the wizard, which is the only way to exercise the `asset:<name>`
contract end to end.

## What the bench measures

Beyond validation:

- **Readability**, from the host's own `window.__noacgTextChecks` (occlusion, clip, safe
  area) - the same `src/video/textChecks.js` the injected validator probes with, so the
  bench and the generation gate cannot drift apart.
- **Repair rounds and their causes**, read off the API calls themselves (a repair round's
  message quotes the exact findings) - and each rejected source is written to
  `<id>.rejected-N.<ext>`, because a rejected result keeps the previous code in the store and
  the repair request is the only surviving copy of what the model actually wrote.
- **Real token usage**, from the API responses. The probe self-checks: if it fails to
  install, the run errors rather than reporting a fictional "0 tokens, 0 repair rounds"
  (an early run reported exactly that, wrongly).
- **Dead space** - the largest rectangle of the frame carrying no designed element at the
  hold, backdrops excluded. A metric and an outlier detector, **not** a pass/fail gate and
  not something to tune against; see the variance finding below.
- **Dead controls** (HyperFrames) - declared composition variables nothing binds. Now
  enforced by the validator, so this stays as an independent audit of that rule.

## Findings that changed the code

### The offline rule rejected inline SVG (contract failure, unfixable by repair)

`network-url` matched `/https?:\/\//` across the whole document, which hits
`xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"` - the namespace every inline `<svg>` carries - and any
URL inside a comment. The failure mode was the worst kind: the message told the model to
"reference uploaded assets as asset:<name>", meaningless advice for a namespace, so **both
repair rounds were unwinnable by construction** and the generation failed outright. Observed
on a countdown that drew its ring pulse in SVG, at 3x the token cost of a clean run.

Fixed by making the rule precise rather than weaker: comments are stripped first, W3C
namespace URIs are excluded, and every real network reference - remote image, font,
stylesheet, script - still fails. Pinned in `e2e/video-hyperframes.spec.ts`.

### Type was sized by height fraction, so it failed in both directions

Compositions sized hero type as a fraction of frame height, which knows nothing about how
long the title is or how wide the chosen face runs. Result: under-scale on short strings
(titles spanning a third of the frame) *and* clipped text on long ones (a fixture line
running off both edges).

The prompt's fit formula assumed ~0.6 em per uppercase character for every face. Measured
against the actual bundled woff2 files, they span nearly 2x:

| Face | measured em/char (heaviest weight) |
|---|---|
| Archivo | 0.74 |
| Inter | 0.68 |
| Manrope | 0.65 |
| Space Grotesk | 0.61 |
| JetBrains Mono | 0.60 |
| Oswald | 0.52 |
| Bebas Neue | 0.38 |

A single 0.6 constant therefore overflows the wide faces by ~23% and leaves the narrow ones
~37% short - both observed failures, one cause. The measurement now lives on each font
(`capAdvance` in `src/video/videoFonts.ts`) and is emitted into the font list both engine
contracts read; the sizing rule gives a width **floor** (55-80% of frame width) as well as a
ceiling.

**Very short heroes are carved out.** A countdown "3" would need a ~1400px font to span 55%
of the frame, so the rule was ignored and the numeral came out small. At roughly three
characters or fewer, height governs (35-60% of frame height). This is arithmetic, not taste.

### Dead controls

A declared composition variable that nothing binds renders a control in the Content panel
that does nothing when dragged - a promise the document does not keep, and one no validator
rule caught because the document is otherwise perfectly legal. Prompt guidance held for six
generations and then missed one (an accent declared, then written as a hex literal); across
36 it missed three. Binding is deterministic and checkable, so the validator now enforces it,
naming all three binding routes (`data-var-text`, `data-var-src`, `var(--id)`). Those are the
complete set of routes a value can take into a composition, so the check cannot miss one.

### The exported standalone HTML shipped a broken image

Opened over `file://` with no app and no server, an exported composition carried
`src="asset:noacg-icon-amber-512"` verbatim. `asset:` is a NoaCG convention - nothing outside
this app resolves it - so a downloaded file with an uploaded logo showed a broken image,
against the plug-and-play export pillar. The export now inlines asset data URLs alongside the
fonts and GSAP. (The exported file's timeline stays paused with no driver, which is
deliberate: the export targets HyperFrames tooling, which supplies its own.)

### The bench key made the e2e suite spend money

The suite pins offline mode through `webServer.env`, but `reuseExistingServer` means a server
already running on this checkout's port is reused with whatever `.env` it started from - and
this workflow puts a real key there. The stub-provider video specs then drove the REAL
provider: six failed as a baffling "no assistant turn in 10 s", each having fired a live
generation first. `expectOfflineAi` (`e2e/_video.ts`) now asserts the transport before the
wizard is touched, so the run stops with the cause named and *before* any spend.

## Findings that did not change the code

### Dead space cannot A/B a prompt change

Three samples of the same brief, same prompt, same model, differ by a **median of 16 points
on HyperFrames and 23 on Remotion** (largest observed: 10% / 33% / 11%). Any effect worth
chasing is an order of magnitude below that noise floor; detecting a 5-point shift would need
tens of samples per brief per arm.

So: dead space works as an **outlier detector** ("this frame is mostly empty") and not as a
mean-shift metric. Do not commission runs to prove a prompt change moved it. Both engines
score about the same on it (24.3% vs 23.4%), which does at least retire the worry that
HyperFrames composes worse than Remotion.

### Design-taste changes could not be shown to help

Two were tried and are **not** in the code: a frame-balance rule in `MOTION_PRINCIPLES`, and
a second canonical example intended to break the "centred word on a dark gradient" default.
Neither produced a measurable improvement at the sample sizes available, and the second
pushes against the deliberate decision to stop art-directing the examples. The general lesson
is the variance one above: at these sample sizes, taste changes are unfalsifiable, so prefer
changes that are *correct by construction* (measured font widths, deterministic checks) over
changes that need a benchmark to justify them.

## Reliability

Across two independent multi-sample runs (18 generations each, six brief types from a 2.5 s
ident to a 6 s multi-element sequence, one driven by a real uploaded asset), **HyperFrames
was 36/36 contract-valid** - level with Remotion. It composes equivalently, fails in the same
ways, and recovers through the same repair loop.

Reliability is therefore not what keeps the engine flagged experimental. Feature coverage is:
no `<video>`/`<audio>` clips, no sub-compositions, image-variable changes reload the preview.

> **Note on the readability-gate numbers.** An earlier round measured a

## The varied-brief pass (14 generations, $1.62)

Seven briefs through both engines, one sample each, chosen to exercise what had just
changed rather than to re-measure known ground: the two hardest chips, a brief with a **real
uploaded asset**, a **transparent overlay** (never benched before), a deliberately **long**
title, and a **single-word** hero (the short-hero height carve-out).

| | HyperFrames | Remotion |
|---|---|---|
| Contract-valid | 7/7 | 7/7 |
| Clean | 6/7 | 7/7 |
| Repair rounds | 4 | 2 |
| Readability findings | 1 run | 0 runs |
| Dead controls | 0 | 0 |
| Tokens | 86,830 in / 70,674 out | 69,713 in / 60,085 out |
| Cost | $0.88 | $0.74 |

Both engines validated everything. **Input tokens roughly halved** against earlier rounds
(~7-8k vs ~16-20k per run) because the coder prompt now carries one worked example rather
than two - the second example was tried and dropped, and this is the measured cost it was
adding.

The **transparent overlay was the hardest brief on both engines** - the only readability
finding in the set (HyperFrames) and the most repair rounds on each. Everything else,
including the long title and the single-word hero, came through clean on both.

### The one real defect, and what it revealed

HyperFrames' transparent lower-third shipped with **both text lines completely invisible**.
Measured in the preview: the strap sits at x = -1551 through the entire hold - still parked
in its entrance position, ~124% of its own width off the left edge. The composition's own
timing is correct (hold 0.70-3.15 s of 4 s), so the entrance tween never took effect;
the likeliest cause is the script it wrote to re-measure and re-set the panel width running
after the timeline was built, invalidating the percentage-based `from` value.

Three things follow, and they matter more than the single defect:

1. **The check was right.** "100% of its width is clipped" was not a false positive - the
   text really was off-frame. Verified by measuring the geometry directly.
2. **The current validator rejects this composition.** Re-run against the saved source with
   the real bridge, it fails. So the gate catches it *today*.
3. **Yet it was applied at generation time**, after two repair rounds that made it worse
   (55% clipped → 100%). The app does not apply failed results - it keeps the previous
   version and says so - which means validation *passed* at that moment and fails now on the
   same source. That gap is unexplained and is the most valuable open thread here: something
   about the state the validator probes differs from the settled preview. The reproducer is
   saved and needs no tokens to chase.

### A correction to this document's own metric

**Dead space is meaningless for a transparent project.** An overlay is supposed to leave the
frame empty - footage is playing there. The benched lower-third measured 67% "dead" on
Remotion while being a perfectly reasonable design. The bench now reports `n/a (overlay)` for
transparent runs instead of a number that invites the wrong reading. The earlier finding that
dead space cannot A/B a prompt change stands; this narrows where it means anything at all.

### Export self-containment, verified outside NoaCG

An exported composition with an uploaded logo was opened over `file://` in a clean browser
context **with every network request aborted**:

- nothing was even attempted over the network (zero blocked requests);
- no unresolved `asset:` references; the logo renders from its inlined data URL;
- 7 `@font-face` rules present, and `document.fonts.check` confirms the bundled faces
  (Archivo, Oswald, Bebas Neue) actually load from their embedded data URLs;
- GSAP present, timeline registered, no page errors.

(A first attempt reported the fonts as unusable; that was a flawed width-comparison probe,
not a real failure - `fonts.check` is the authoritative test.)

## Open follow-ups

Ordered by value. The first needs no tokens and is the most important.

1. **Why did a composition the validator rejects get applied?** The transparent lower-third
   above passed validation at generation time and fails the same validator now, on the same
   source. Either the probe observes a state the settled preview does not (a script that
   mutates layout after boot is one candidate - this composition has exactly that), or the
   persistence rule dropped a finding that a later sample would have caught. **Reproducer,
   no generation needed:** load the saved composition through
   `validateHyperframesComposition` with the real bridge (`transparent: true`, 4 s) and
   compare against the same source probed after an apply + replay. If the two disagree, the
   gate has a state-dependence bug and every quality figure that rests on it is soft.
2. **The transparent/overlay brief is the weakest case on both engines** - the only
   readability finding in the varied pass, the most repairs on each engine, and the one
   design shape neither contract says much about (where a strap sits, safe margins, not
   filling the frame). This is the strongest candidate for a *measured* prompt improvement,
   but it needs more than one sample per engine before anyone writes prose.
3. **Sharpen the repair message when text looks duplicated.** An earlier rejection failed
   because the finding told the model to resize a line whose real problem was that it had
   been rendered twice ("NOACGNOACG"). A finding that notices a repeated substring and says
   so would probably be fixable inside the two rounds.
4. **The countdown-style minimal reveal** - historically the weakest brief, and the
   "uncommitted default" look it falls into is unmoved by prose. It came through clean in
   this pass, so treat the earlier finding as unconfirmed rather than settled.
5. **`<video>` / `<audio>` clips** - the largest deliberate divergence from real HyperFrames.
   A real feature (validator, driver, compose, and the render worker all have to agree on how
   a media clip seeks deterministically), not a prompt change.

## Handoff

**State.** Everything described here is on `main`. The bench supports both engines
(`--engine`), runs free against the offline provider (`--stub`), and records tokens, repair
rounds and their causes, the sources that failed a repair round, dead space, and dead
controls. Offline coverage is 14/14 clean across both engines and all seven briefs.

**What is trustworthy.** Contract validity (36/36 across two earlier multi-sample runs, 14/14
here), the deterministic checks (unbound variables, namespace URLs, asset inlining), the
measured font widths, and export self-containment - all verified directly rather than
inferred.

**What is not.** Any figure resting on the readability gate is soft until follow-up 1 is
resolved. Design-taste conclusions are unreliable at these sample sizes and should not be
drawn from single runs; the within-brief spread is wide enough to swamp anything worth
chasing.

**Cost discipline.** A clean generation is ~7-8k in / ~6-7k out (about $0.08). A run with two
repair rounds costs roughly three times that. Always prove a bench change with `--stub`
first; never touch `.env` while a run is in flight; and keep `VITE_SUPABASE_*` unset on the
dev server the bench drives.
