// The MCP entrance, offline.
//
// `noacg mcp` is one of the three ways an agent reaches the door (docs/AGENT_CLI.md), and until
// this file it was the only one with no test that runs in CI: unit.test.mjs covers the terminal
// entrance, and everything the MCP server does end to end lives in smoke.test.mjs, which skips
// itself whenever no bridge answers. So the surface an installed plugin actually talks to could
// change shape - a verb renamed, an argument dropped, `caspar` quietly exposed - and every green
// run in this repository would have said nothing.
//
// What is covered is what a fault would make INVISIBLE rather than loud:
//
//   - the server exposes ONE tool, `noacg`, whose `command` enum is exactly the seven authoring
//     verbs, and `caspar` is NOT among them. That exclusion is a deliberate rule (it drives live
//     playout hardware, which is an operator's decision and not an authoring agent's) and it was
//     prose only. Prose does not fail a build.
//   - the tool carries a title, a description and the arguments the docs promise, and every
//     argument's description opens with the verbs that read it - the schema is where an agent
//     learns which flag belongs to which verb, and it is generated from the same table that
//     refuses a stray argument.
//   - the schema stays SMALL. An MCP client puts it into the model's context in every session
//     where the server is configured, NoaCG-related or not (docs/AGENT_CLI.md "What a session
//     pays" measured the seven-tool shape at about 1,160 tokens and this one at about 590). The
//     ceiling here is in characters, which is what the token count follows; a teaching sentence
//     added to a description fails it, which is the point - the teaching belongs in the skill.
//   - the server identifies itself as `noacg` at the package's own version - what an MCP client
//     shows the user, and what the plugin manifests are stamped from.
//   - `docs` answers WITHOUT a deployment. It is the one verb that reads the shipped skill off
//     disk, so an agent can learn the contract before it has a bridge, a browser or a key - and a
//     refactor that routed it through the bridge would break that silently.
//   - a verb missing its argument, or given one it does not read, is a usage error naming the
//     argument, not a bridge attempt and never a silent drop.
//   - the doc topics are also resources, and an unknown topic is an error rather than a hang.
//
// Nothing here starts a browser or reaches a deployment: NOACG_URL points at a closed port, and
// only the verbs that need no bridge are ever CALLED.
//
// Run `npm run build` first - this drives the built `dist/`.
