// The plugin's MCP entrance. It exists to run `noacg mcp` in ONE process.
//
// The plugin used to declare `npx -y @noacg/cli mcp`, and npx cannot do that job cheaply. It
// resolves the package, spawns the real binary with `stdio: 'inherit'`, and then stays alive for
// the whole session with nothing left to do but forward the child's exit code. Measured on
// 2026-09-02 (docs/backlog/cli-mcp-startup-weight.md): that launcher process holds ~85 MB of
// private bytes for hours, and npx adds roughly 1.5-4 s to every session start. Pinning the
// version does not help - the cost is npx's own machinery, not the "what is latest?" lookup.
// An MCP server declared by a plugin starts in EVERY session that has the plugin installed, so
// both costs are paid by people who never touch a NoaCG graphic that day.
//
// So: find the CLI, then `import` it here instead of spawning it. Same process, same stdio, no
// wrapper. The npx path stays as the LAST resort, because zero-install is a real feature - a
// fresh user with no global install must still get a working server, and for them this stays
// exactly as expensive as the plugin already was, never more.
