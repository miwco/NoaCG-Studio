# The `noacg-mcp` plugin (Claude Code + Codex)

The NoaCG CLI as an **always-on MCP server**, packaged as a plugin so one command installs it. It
is optional. The `noacg` plugin next to it (`cli/plugin/`) carries the skill and the command and
runs no server. Its skill drives the same CLI from the terminal, and a session that is not about
NoaCG pays nothing for it. Install this one when you want the `noacg` tool present in every
session - a browser kept warm between calls, screenshots returned as images - or when your client
has no shell to run the CLI in.

What it costs, measured 2026-09-02 (`docs/AGENT_CLI.md`, "What a session pays"): one process of
about 37 MB private bytes for the life of every session, and about 590 tokens of tool schema in
every session's context. That is the whole reason it is a separate plugin.

| Piece | What it is |
|---|---|
| `.mcp.json` | The `noacg` MCP server: `node mcp-server.mjs`. One tool, `noacg`, whose `command` is the CLI verb (`types`, `scaffold`, `validate`, `inspect`, `screenshot`, `docs`, `save`) and whose other arguments are the verb's flags. The skill's references are also resources at `noacg://docs/<topic>`. |
| `mcp-server.mjs` | The launcher. It resolves `@noacg/cli` (`NOACG_CLI`, a normal resolve, then a global install found through the `noacg` shim on PATH) and `import`s it in the same process, so the server is ONE process rather than npx plus a child. With no installed copy it falls back to npx in-process and says so on stderr. |
| `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` | The manifests. Their `version` is stamped from `cli/package.json` by `cli/scripts/build-skill.mjs`. |

## Install

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add miwco/NoaCG-Studio
claude plugin install noacg@noacg-studio        # the skill and the command
claude plugin install noacg-mcp@noacg-studio    # this server, if you want it
npm i -g @noacg/cli                             # one process instead of npx plus a child
```

From a checkout, for one session only: `claude --plugin-dir ./cli/plugin --plugin-dir ./cli/plugin-mcp`,
with `NOACG_CLI=<checkout>/cli/dist/index.js` to run the local build.

**Codex**: `codex plugin add noacg-mcp@noacg-studio` from the same marketplace. Codex copies a
plugin directory whole, `.mcp.json` included, and on 2026-08-27 that registered the combined
plugin's server without a line in `~/.codex/config.toml`; this split plugin, with its
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` launcher, has not been re-verified on Codex yet (`docs/AGENT_CLI.md`,
"What a session pays", still open).

**Any MCP client**, without the plugin: `noacg mcp` over stdio (`npx -y @noacg/cli mcp` with
nothing installed). A graphics project can also declare the server in its own `.mcp.json`, which
is the one way to have it in exactly the sessions that are about graphics and nowhere else.
