# Keeping the work - and this system - coherent

## Big projects are phased, never one-shotted

Owner, 2026-08-28, for the big roads ahead (the editor, the desktop client, broadcast-scale
control): *"they can't be one-shotted… planned out step by step and implemented with care, one
thing at a time"* - and *"we are not in a hurry. Enterprise software takes years."* The rules:

- **The owner understands it BEFORE it is built.** A big project starts with a DESIGN PICTURE the
  owner can see - the actual screens, menus and flows that will exist, end to end - and he
  ratifies that picture once. *"If I do not 100% understand what we are building then the agent
  might not either."*
- **The agent says what it does not understand.** Uncertainty is stated, never smoothed over with
  confidence - a double-check question in the plan costs a sentence; a confidently wrong phase
  costs the phase. This is not approval-gating: once the picture is ratified, phases run WITHOUT
  per-step human checks.
- **Phases chain automatically.** Each phase is its own session-sized step with its own
  verification and definition of done; the next phase starts from the landed handoff plus a
  fresh-eyes check of what the previous phase built (`night.md`, continuations). The timeline
  lives in the project's plan doc, and the wave loop or the next plan triggers the next phase - a
  human appears at phase boundaries only when the plan names a decision that is genuinely his.
- **Work smart, keep the end game in mind.** A phase that serves the deadline but bends the
  ratified picture gets flagged, not silently shipped.
- **The record of which pictures are ratified is `docs/PROGRAMMES.md`** (the register, itself
  ratified 2026-09-01). A big project IS a programme: its ratification, state, entry conditions,
  scope edges and reopen triggers live there; the argument and the acceptance claims live in
  `docs/NORTH_STAR_2027.md`. Never mark a capability complete because its implementation exists -
  a claim advances only when its evidence rung is satisfied.

## The coherence cadence

**A growing project rots its own context, and rot reads as the agents getting dumber.** The model
does not degrade; the written surface does - stale docs teach wrong things, contracts drift apart,
the big picture smears across files until no session can hold it. The standing defences are
structural (the instruction-chain byte RATCHET that only tightens, handoffs consumed not
collected, backlog items that graduate or die, memory entries with exit conditions, and this
system's own 200-line gate) - but defences that only fire locally miss global drift. GOALS.md's
~200-line budget and its archive belong in that list only in INTENTION: nothing measures the
budget, so the file drifts over and is pulled back by hand whenever a coherence round happens to
look. It was 419 lines when `docs/backlog/goals-over-its-own-budget.md` was filed, 261 after the
2026-08-30 round cut it, and over budget in both readings. **Quote the measurement, never the
number** - a line count written into prose is stale within days, which this sentence proved by
carrying 419 into 2026-09-02.

So roughly **weekly, one wave carries a COHERENCE SESSION** - fresh context, no other task:

1. **The cold-read test, first and most important:** answer, from root `AGENTS.md` +
   `docs/GOALS.md` alone, what this product is, what the current push is, and what is deliberately
   parked. Every place the answer came out wrong or slow is a doc defect to fix. **Slow counts as
   wrong**: an internal doc earns its length by what a cold reader can act on, and the public-docs
   voice rule (`src/docs/AGENTS.md` "The voice") is the standard here too, one rule short of its
   em-dash gate. Contracts keep their reasoning density, because the reason is what stops the rule
   being re-litigated - but a paragraph that argues with itself, or a section nobody can summarise
   after reading it once, is the same defect as a stale claim and is fixed the same way.
2. Contradictions between contracts (nested AGENTS.md vs root, docs vs code) - fix or file.
3. Docs nothing references and references to nothing - delete or repair; git is the archive.
4. The byte ratchet: tighten `project_doc_max_bytes` where headroom allows. It only moves down.
5. GOALS drift: does ## NOW still match what waves actually built? Report the gap - the owner
   rules on direction.

Its output is small diffs plus a one-page verdict in its handoff. When no wave has carried one for
over a week, the next plan says so in section 4.

## Applying a wave's lesson to this system

The rule is in the core ("Every wave improves the orchestration system"): a recurring failure
becomes a mechanism before it becomes text. This is the order of preference when the lesson is an
orchestration lesson - a collision class the plan missed, a report section that failed its reader,
a rule that was ambiguous under pressure. Product lessons are not this: they go to the taste rubric
via the owner's rulings, to `docs/backlog/`, or to a prompt. The test: would the fix change what a
SESSION builds, or how a WAVE is planned? Only the second belongs here.

1. **A hook**, where the mistake has a tool shape - it fires at the call, whether or not anyone
   read a contract (`scripts/hooks/`, `docs/AGENT_WORKFLOWS.md`). A hook that can false-positive is
   a warning; a refusal needs an exact test.
2. **A script or a test**, where the fact can be measured - the tick, the drain, the plan check,
   the receipts. A contract sentence about what a script does, or a number written into prose, is
   a cache of the instrument; cite the instrument and its test instead. Six such caches went false
   within a week of the split (`incidents.md`, "the four cached facts of 2026-09-02").
3. **Durable state**, where a decision must outlive the session that made it - the wave-state file,
   a receipt, a ledger line.
4. **Text, last, and by MOVING, never by adding.** The lesson edits the module that owns the rule,
   its evidence goes to `incidents.md` in one dated entry, and a new rule names what it replaced
   or shrank - budget-neutral by default, and the report says so when nothing could be cut. The
   core changes only for a rule that fires before its module loads, and only against its gate.
   The gate counts the core and the common path; the branch modules (`night`, `recovery`, this
   file, `incidents`) it does not, so their only counterweight is this rule and the coherence
   session reading them cold. The old single file reached 924 lines by obeying "every wave
   improves this file" with no second half.

`npm run check:shared-instructions` fails on a core over 200 lines, on a common path over its
budget, on a module nothing links to, on a link to a module that does not exist, and on an
`npm run` script the contract names that `package.json` does not have. Orphans, dead links and
stale commands are how a modular system rots into a single file with extra steps.
