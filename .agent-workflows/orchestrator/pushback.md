# Section 4 - what I would push back on

**Mandatory. Never omit it, and never soften it to be agreeable.** The user asked for this section
because a day was once planned with four of six sessions serving goals the roadmap had explicitly
parked. **What does NOT belong here: a DESIGN DEFAULT.** How a thing looks, which of two behaviours
is conventional, what a designer would expect - the row DECIDES it and says what it decided and why,
so he can overrule a thing that exists rather than adjudicate one that does not, and it never
becomes a section-4 flag, a `walk-p` item or a prompt step. What still reaches him is enumerated
where the ruling landed (owner 2026-09-03, `docs/acceptance/OWNER_QUEUE.md`, "A design default is
NOT a taste question"). Say plainly, then:

- **Which tasks do not serve the current push** (`grounding.md` names the two sections that settle
  this). A task can be good and still be wrong for today.
- **Real money.** Any task spending API money is called out UP FRONT with an estimate, and waits
  for an explicit go-ahead. A key in `.env` is not permission.
- **Size.** A structural rewrite of a primary surface, started beside four other sessions,
  deserves the sentence "are you sure, today?".
- **Work that is not ready** - an undecided design decision, or a dependency still in flight.
- **Cheap-check-first.** Where a reported defect has a known one-line cause, say so and put that
  check at the top of the prompt rather than opening an investigation.
- **A task you cannot write a WHY for.** Hand it over anyway, and say exactly that here.
- **An ask that is a faster horse.** When the requested MECHANISM is not the best route to the
  stated why, say so here and offer the better route beside it.
- **A DETAIL this wave is serving by other means** - a number, a wording, an old receipt's `asked:`
  line (core, "INTENT BINDS, THE DETAIL DOES NOT"). It belongs HERE, as news, and **never in the
  owner queue as a decision he must ratify or overrule**: that queue records what he must SEE, it
  is not a ballot (`incidents.md`, "the 99% that nobody asked for").
- **An owner ask that does not serve NoaCG** (asked for by name, 2026-09-03, quoted in
  `docs/OWNER_RULINGS.md`). Pushback is not refusal and never delays the work - the concern and its
  alternative go here, the prompt still goes in section 5, and the disagreement is recorded BEFORE
  the wave runs.
- **Anything a classifier refused**, with its full prompt and the reason, so the owner can start
  it himself (`launch.md`).
- **The owner-queue depth**, as a number. It is a record, never a gate - he should know how much
  is waiting, and the row is planned anyway.
- **Every unstarted owner receipt this plan does not start**, by slug, with its age and the reason
  it waits (held for a wave of its own, parked on a ruling, deferred behind the push). An owner
  ask that is neither planned nor named here has been forgotten, which is the failure the receipt
  exists to end.
- **A wave that carried no coherence session for over a week** - measured, not recalled:
  `git log -1 --format=%cs --grep=coherence` (`coherence.md`).

If there is genuinely nothing to push back on, one line saying so. Do not invent a concern.

**Every pasted task gets a prompt.** Flagging is not vetoing: the concern goes above, the prompt
still goes below, and the decision stays the user's.
