# Section 5 - the prompts

One fenced block per session, in START order, each pasteable into a fresh session. Compact -
target ~20 lines. The pool decision each block rests on is `routing.md`.

Open the section with a **one-line run order** naming the letters and nothing else, so the user sees
the shape before reading a prompt: *"Start now: A, B, C, D. E follows on A landing. F held."*

```
SESSION A - <three-word name>
BRANCH <tool>/a-<name>
MODEL  opus high - <what KIND of thinking this task rewards>
START  now
TOUCHES <files>   MINTS <slot, or ->
GOAL   One sentence: what is true when this is done.
WHY    The real problem it solves, or the goal it serves.
READ   file, file, file.
DO     1. …  2. …  3. …
CORE   which steps are the core; the rest is the tail a short session cuts first.
TRAPS  only what is written in no repo file
GATE   npm run build, then push and read the CI run - check WHICH jobs ran. Commit each verified step.
QUEUE  Then, as your LAST THREE actions and in this order:
       1. run /check (review, simplify, verify) on the branch - name each leg's mode;
       2. write docs/handoffs/<date>-a-<slug>.md: what is left and why, evidence and traps that
          exist in no repo file, anything that needs the owner, and pointers (commits, the check
          stamp, the owner-queue item) - what landed is one line of commit pointers, never a story;
       3. run /queue-merge. Do not commit after queueing: queueing pins the branch, and a later
          commit makes the landing job refuse. Never merge into main yourself.
       Never end a turn waiting on something that cannot wake you - a CI run, a landing, a
       watcher. Read it to a verdict now, or hand off.
```

## The line rules

- **`SESSION <letter>` is the first line, always**, before the branch and before anything else.
  Same letter as the wave table, same letter as the branch name. This line exists for the user
  scrolling back at 4pm, not for the session reading it.
- **There is no `WAIT` line, because a wave is order-free.** `START` is `now` for every session
  the user starts. The only other value is `on <branch> landing`, and that belongs to a follow-on
  this workflow launches itself - never to a prompt the user is asked to hold.
- **No prompt ever contains a step for the user, and no session blocks on a question.** Not "ask
  the owner", not "wait for approval". A session that stops to ask does nothing all night: it
  decides with the WHY, or writes the question into its handoff and does the rest. The owner
  dropping in to talk to a running session is always welcome and never required - a wave must
  finish identically with or without it. Anything that genuinely needs the user is a note in
  section 4, never a line in a prompt.
- **Claude Code prompts the USER starts open with a Remote Control reminder** while the
  auto-connect bug stands: the session's first output tells the user to type `/remote-control` (a
  session cannot invoke terminal built-ins itself). An auto-launched subagent has no terminal, so
  it gets no reminder. Temporary - drop this bullet when new sessions reach the phone on their
  own; the memory `remote-control-every-session` carries the exit test.
- **`<tool>` is whichever tool will run it** - `claude/…` or `codex/…`. Never hardcode one.
- **GOAL is a DEFINITION OF DONE, and the session self-checks against it before the handoff.**
  Write it as a claim a reader could test by observation - never "improve X". Before the handoff,
  the session checks every claim against the evidence it holds: a number against its measurement,
  "works" against a run that showed it working. Anything it cannot back is UNVERIFIED, never
  rounded up - a wave whose handoffs overclaim costs the owner a morning of re-checking. A green
  build alone is never "done" for observable work (root `AGENTS.md`, verification rules 1 and 7).
- **THE WHY MUST BE TRUE, and function outranks cosmetics.** GOAL says what will be true; WHY says
  what breaks otherwise, so the session can TEST the assignment instead of obeying it. A session
  sensing a cosmetic why behind a functional cost keeps the function, does the rest, and puts the
  tension in the handoff (`incidents.md` "the vanity rename").
- **WHY is a TARGET, not a route.** DO is the planner's best route to it: a better route inside the
  row's `TOUCHES` is built and reported, one that changes scope is argued in the handoff instead.
  Every session asks once before step 1 - do these steps serve the WHY, or only the letter of the
  ask? A faster horse built perfectly is a failed assignment. **The repo outranks the plan** the
  same way: a named file that does not do what its row says is wrong, never authoritative - find
  the real one, work against it, and name both, so the planner's error is visible not absorbed.
  A DETAIL quoted into a prompt is evidence of intent, never a specification (core, "INTENT BINDS,
  THE DETAIL DOES NOT") - say so IN THE ROW, so it serves the intent by the better means.
- **READ points, it never summarizes.** Name the files; the session reads them at current HEAD.
- **TRAPS carries only what exists nowhere but a chat.** A trap already in a repo file gets a
  pointer. Reprinting an area contract is how these get fat.
- **DO is verifiable steps**, not a topic list. Reproduce-before-fixing for any bug.
- **BRANCH is a LABEL until the row renames it.** `isolation: worktree` mints `worktree-agent-<id>`,
  nothing applies the BRANCH line, and no check compares them - so DO step 1 is `git branch -m
  <branch>` and a confirm it took, since it fails when that name already exists (`launch.md`).
- **A starting prompt is a MULTI-STEP ASSIGNMENT, and should be big.** Not one task - a numbered
  run of them, each finishing before the next begins, each committed once verified, all on the one
  branch and queued at the end: one branch, one gate and one landing instead of three, and step two
  gets step one's context free. Everything in it belongs to the same `TOUCHES` set.
- **CORE says where a long session may stop.** A prompt with six steps and no stated core is a
  prompt that lands nothing when step four goes wrong.
- **GATE is `npm run build` plus CI**, because the per-change suite belongs to CI, not the laptop
  - add a local browser job only for the work from the collision pass that CI cannot do.
- **QUEUE is mandatory on every prompt and is the last thing in it**, because the session running
  it may never see this file. Landing is serialized, not permissioned: a finished session queues
  itself and the machine-wide queue lands it - gated on CI, one branch at a time, pushing when it
  wins (`.agent-workflows/queue-merge.md`). The handoff FILE is written first, `/queue-merge`
  second, so the handoff is inside what lands. **Say what to do with unfinished work, once, in
  QUEUE**: commit and queue only what is green and stands on its own, leave the rest uncommitted
  and describe it in the handoff. Never queue a branch you have not gated to beat the morning.
- **/check runs in EVERY wave session, day or night.** The one carve-out stays honest rather than
  silent: a session out of time queues without it and its handoff says `check: not run`. The
  second-opinion workflow (`so`) is for big calls, and it runs in a fresh session by design, so a
  wave session can never get one on its own work - plan it as its own row.
- **Queue ONCE, at the true end.** Queueing pins the branch's commit, so a session that queues,
  then commits more, then queues again turns every earlier job into a stale-pin refusal
  (`warn-command.mjs` now says so at the commit). Batch the commits; the last action of the
  session is the one queue call.
- **Landing friction is a first-class defect.** The owner's measure of a good wave is hours spent
  building versus hours spent shepherding merges. The report counts refusals and re-queues as
  vitals, and every recurring refusal kind becomes a mechanism fix, never a habit.
- **A finished session leaves nothing running.** Before its last action it stops every background
  task it started - watchers, polls, queued waits - because a task nobody will ever read is not
  monitoring. Anything a running task was holding goes into the handoff file first. The Stop hook
  (`scripts/hooks/stop-wait.mjs`) refuses a turn that ends on a wait; the prompt line above is
  what it enforces.
- **A continuation prompt printed only in chat does not exist.** The handoff FILE is the one
  channel the next orchestrator reads. Chat is for the human watching; the file is for the system.
- A row that **delegates** says so in the prompt and names its fallback pool, on `routing.md`'s
  terms (step 3 and its Done-when line).
- **A prompt that sanctions a fan-out says: collect results via FILES at agreed paths, never wait
  on notifications.** A launched session never receives its own subagents' completion
  notifications - they route to this orchestrator, which relays any stray report to the owning
  session. Paid for twice; evidence: `incidents.md` "the fan-out that waited on notifications".

## The confirmation pass - one sweep, before the plan ships

**Every prompt is a PLAN, not a dispatch**, and a plan's facts are CHECKED, never recalled.
Starting many sessions at once never excuses a thin prompt: each one is written with plan-mode
care - the why stated so the session can test the assignment, the route reasoned rather than
guessed, the traps named. **Then ONE PASS over the finished prompts CONFIRMS every fact in them:**

- every path in a `TOUCHES` or `READ` line grepped and seen doing the thing its row is about (a
  grep with a line range, never an open) - `node scripts/wave-plan-check.mjs` proves existence,
  and only the grep proves the file does what the row says;
- every command it names found where its kind lives - `package.json`, `scripts/`, or
  `.agent-workflows/` for a slash command;
- every rule it quotes copied from the file rather than from memory.

Neither a directory listing nor a plausible name is confirmation. It is a PASS not a virtue because
care is what runs out at the end of a long grounding read. The cost is not a wasted lookup:
`TOUCHES` is the collision pass's instrument, so two rows called disjoint on paths nobody confirmed
are not disjoint, they are unanalysed - a guessed path is a defective collision pass in the costume
of a typo, **so a correction here sends those rows back through the collision pass.**
