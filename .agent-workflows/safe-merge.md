# safe-merge - land one branch on main, in the right order

Shared canonical procedure for the `safe-merge` workflow - `/safe-merge` in Claude Code,
`$safe-merge` in Codex. Cross-references use plain names ("the cleanup-worktrees workflow").

Do NOT print git commands for the user to run - execute each phase, report what you find, and
stop whenever reality disagrees with the happy path.

Branch to merge: the invocation argument, if any. With none, drain the queue: rank every branch
ahead of `main` with `merge-order.mjs` and land the `clear` ones in that order, one at a time,
stopping at the first failure and reporting what is left.

## When this may run

Landing is serialized, not permissioned (root `AGENTS.md`, "Git"). Nobody waits on an approval;
what a run waits on is the other branches.

**A human still starts each run today.** The Claude adapter keeps `disable-model-invocation: true`
and the shared-instruction gate enforces it, so the model cannot invoke this as a tool of its own
accord. Two things count as a real invocation: the user typing the command
(`/safe-merge`, `$safe-merge`), or **the user SELECTING this workflow from a pick another workflow
offered** for a named branch - a pick is a decision about a specific branch, so honour it by
running this procedure rather than answering "type the command yourself". Acting on a pick means
reading this file and following it directly; the adapter is only a pointer here anyway. Never
infer an invocation from a request to inspect or discuss a merge, or from work merely looking
finished.

**Unattended landing of `clear` branches arrives with the job runner**, not before
(`docs/JOB_RUNNER_PLAN.md`, rollout step 4). The owner's condition for automation was that it stay
visible - "it just needs to be clear that something is merging" - and the queue plus the
SessionStart summary are what make it visible. Lifting the flag before that would deliver the
automation without the condition attached to it.

Whoever starts the run, a **`caution` or `hold`** verdict stops and asks. Those are the cases that
historically went wrong - a stacked branch jumping its ancestor, two branches minting one
migration number, a rename over another branch's edits.

Never enqueue anything PAST `main` here: `npm publish`, production migrations and anything
costing money stay owner-triggered, because a later commit cannot take them back.

## Repo layout

- `main` is normally checked out at the repo root (`C:\claude\NoaCG-Studio`) - but never ASSUME
  it; read `git worktree list` every run.
- Feature worktrees usually live under `.claude/worktrees/<name>` on `claude/*` or `codex/*`
  branches. Paths and prefixes are never safety signals.
- **The gate is CI green on exactly the commit being promoted** (`ci.yml` triggers on every
  branch push); the local `npm run build` + `npm run test:e2e:integration:queued` pair is the
  fallback. Whichever route runs, BOTH halves are required - typecheck/lint AND e2e. `build`
  alone is not a gate: on 2026-07-30 four template packs landed in a row that each passed it and
  left `main` red for two hours on `catalog-baseline.spec.ts`.
- Standing permission exists to push verified work to `origin/main`, and to push the source
  branch to `origin` so CI can verify it (a plain push, never `--force`).

## Hard safety rules (never break these, even if asked mid-flow)

- Never `push --force`, never `reset --hard`, never delete a branch that isn't fully merged.
- The source must resolve to one exact local branch (`refs/heads/<branch>`), must not be `main`,
  and must be checked out in at most one worktree. Never accept a remote ref, revision
  expression, tag, detached commit, or argument beginning with `-`.
- Update `main` only with `git pull --ff-only`; the final merge is `git merge --ff-only`. Git
  itself must refuse any unexpected non-fast-forward.
- **`MAIN_SYNC`** - local `main` vs `origin/main` before the merge:
  - **Diverged**: hard STOP. Show both sides and let the user decide.
  - **Ahead only**: STOP and require explicit confirmation - the final push would also publish
    those pre-existing local commits, not just the branch.
- Never stash or discard uncommitted changes without asking. Never merge with a dirty source or
  target worktree.
- If a merge hits conflicts you are not confident resolving, `git merge --abort` and report the
  conflicting files rather than guessing.
- Never touch other worktrees' work: merge only the ONE branch, never `checkout`/`switch`/
  `restore` across worktrees, never run `reset`/`clean`/`checkout -- .` in any checkout.
- **Never delete a branch,** and never remove a worktree you did not create in this run. Cleanup
  belongs to the cleanup-worktrees workflow. The single exception is a TEMPORARY worktree this run
  created (identified by the `safe-merge-` prefix AND by having been created in this run - a
  pre-existing folder with that prefix belongs to someone else) - removed in Phase 5, never with
  `--force`, never any other.

## Phase 1 - Assess (reads only)

**Run the checks rather than narrating them:**

    node scripts/safe-merge-preflight.mjs --branch <branch>

It settles the whole assessment in about two seconds - worktree resolution, both trees'
cleanliness, `MAIN_SYNC`, branch-name validation, the merge preview via `git merge-tree`, and the
merge-order verdict - printing every condition PASS/FAIL with the value it found and exiting
non-zero when a blocking one fails. It only reads (its one write-shaped command is `git fetch`,
which touches no working tree and no branch history). **Paste its output.** A condition that was
checked and one that was merely claimed must never again look the same in a report.
`--skip-order` drops the ranking, `--no-fetch` the fetch.

The judgement calls stay here: whether a `hold` should be waved through, whether a conflict is
mechanically resolvable, and in Phase 3 whether a red CI run is a verdict or a damaged run.

The preflight previews the merge with `git merge-base` + `git merge-tree`. **Never use
`git merge --no-commit` as a preview** - it changes the index and the working tree, which is
exactly what an assessment phase must not do.

**Two states the preflight reports that need a decision before Phase 2:**

- **The source branch has no worktree.** Normal here, not an error - a closed session leaves its
  branch behind. Phase 2 creates a temporary one.
- **`main` is checked out nowhere.** Do not assume any checkout is on it. If the root is on a
  detached HEAD that is clean and holds no unreferenced work, Phase 2 reattaches it with
  `node scripts/reattach-main.mjs <root>`, which re-verifies safety itself and declines rather
  than guessing. If the root is on the SOURCE branch, leave it - Phase 4 step 3 reattaches it
  after verification. If neither applies, Phase 2 creates `safe-merge-main`.

Report the plan before changing anything: source -> `main`, commit count, predicted conflicts,
the merge-order verdict verbatim, any worktree Phase 2 will create, and which gate will run.

## Phase 2 - Prepare (update main, then integrate it INTO the branch)

Order matters: main only ever receives an already-tested branch. Conflicts are resolved and
tests run on the BRANCH, never on main.

1. Create any temporary worktree Phase 1 identified (`git worktree add
   .claude/worktrees/safe-merge-<slug> <branch>`, and/or `safe-merge-main main`), or reattach the
   root. "Source worktree" and "the main worktree" mean those from here on. Do not `npm install`
   yet - that happens in step 5, once the branch holds the manifest the gate will use.
2. Re-check both worktrees with `git status --porcelain`. Stop if either became dirty since the
   assessment. A fresh worktree reports clean because `node_modules/` is gitignored; anything
   else means something is wrong.
3. Update main: `git pull --ff-only origin main` in the main worktree. When main has no worktree
   because the root carries the source branch, update the ref in place with
   `git fetch origin main:main` - git refuses that unless it fast-forwards, the same guarantee
   without needing a checkout. Record `INTEGRATED_MAIN_SHA = git rev-parse main`.
4. In the SOURCE worktree: `git merge main`.
5. If step 1 created a worktree, `npm install` in it NOW - after the merge, so the install
   matches the manifest the gate runs under. Resolve step 4's conflicts first; installing against
   a half-merged `package.json` proves nothing.

## Phase 3 - Verify (on the branch, main untouched)

1. Resolve any conflicts carefully. Only what is mechanically obvious; for anything semantic,
   stop and show the hunks. Not confidently resolvable -> `git merge --abort` and report.
   Complete the merge commit before continuing; never verify a half-finished merge.
2. Pin it: `VERIFIED_SHA = git rev-parse <branch>`, and state it. The exact commit that passes
   verification must be the exact commit that becomes `main`.
3. **Route A - CI (prefer this).** CI runs strictly more than a laptop can - build, the affected
   plan sharded across up to nine runners, the factory gates, the catalog tripwire - on a clean
   checkout, in about ten minutes, free (the repo is public).

       git push origin <branch>
       gh run watch --exit-status $(gh run list --branch <branch> --commit <VERIFIED_SHA> \
         --limit 1 --json databaseId --jq '.[0].databaseId')

   Then **have the preflight read the run** rather than eyeballing it:

       node scripts/safe-merge-preflight.mjs --branch <branch> --phase 3 --verified-sha <VERIFIED_SHA>

   It requires the run's head sha to be **exactly** `VERIFIED_SHA` (Phase 2 made a new commit, so
   an earlier run proves nothing about the tree being promoted), its conclusion to be `success`,
   and the `CI gate` job itself green. It also applies the two conditions that decide whether a
   green tick is EVIDENCE at all: whether the e2e shards actually ran, and whether any job is
   damaged rather than failing.

   **A run that skipped every shard is settled by computation, not prose.** The preflight runs the
   affected planner itself on the promoted commit, so the two causes of `mode: none` stop looking
   alike: it passes when the branch diffs to nothing behavioural against `main`, or when an
   earlier green run on this history did run shards and everything changed since plans `none` too.
   It blocks otherwise - the case that used to reach `main` on a sentence, because a second push
   cancels the run in flight and plans only itself while the tick stays green. Force a real run
   instead of arguing: `gh workflow run ci.yml --ref <branch>`.

   **A damaged run is not a red run - it is NO run.** It carries no verdict, so there is nothing
   to fix; fall through to Route B and say so in the report, naming the run, the damaged job and
   the incident. How to tell damage from failure is in `docs/VERIFICATION.md`. Do not sit and
   re-run into an outage: one free retry, and if it also queues without starting, that is
   confirmation.

4. **Route B - locally, when CI is unavailable or you need an answer without pushing.** Both of:
   - `npm run build` - typecheck, lint, bundle.
   - `npm run test:e2e:integration:queued` - the affected plan based at the FORK POINT, not at
     `main`. Phase 2 just merged main in, so a plain affected run would cover only the branch's
     own files and everything main brought in would go unverified. **A clean merge says two diffs
     did not touch the same lines, never that the combined state holds** - which is the whole
     question this phase exists to answer. For a branch that has NOT taken main in,
     `npm run test:e2e:focus:queued` is the same thing and still correct.

   Run it even when the change looks harmless: "it's only templates" is exactly the branch that
   went red, and the script decides what "affected" means. It reports and skips cleanly when the
   diff touches nothing the suite covers, so a docs-only branch costs seconds.

   **Citing a run you already did this session** instead of re-running is allowed only when ALL
   hold, and say which run and when it finished: it was an `affected`/`focus`/`queued` form and
   finished GREEN; same worktree; ran on exactly `VERIFIED_SHA`, AFTER the Phase 2 merge; nothing
   moved, installed or edited since; and `INTEGRATED_MAIN_SHA` still equals `origin/main`. If you
   cannot positively confirm every one, run it again - "I think that run was after the merge" is
   exactly the shape of an assumption that turns out wrong.

5. Anything red on either route is fix-or-abort. A fix is a new commit, so re-record
   `VERIFIED_SHA` and re-verify. Then confirm the source worktree is clean and the branch still
   points at `VERIFIED_SHA`.

## Phase 4 - Re-check main, fast-forward, push

Immediately before merging - main may have moved while you verified. **Run the checks:**

    node scripts/safe-merge-preflight.mjs --branch <branch> --phase 4 \
      --verified-sha <VERIFIED_SHA> --integrated-main-sha <INTEGRATED_MAIN_SHA>

It confirms both worktrees still clean, `<branch>` still at `VERIFIED_SHA`, local `main` still
equal to `origin/main`, `origin/main` still equal to `INTEGRATED_MAIN_SHA`, and the merge still a
fast-forward. Paste the output.

1. **Non-zero exit means main moved: STOP, do not merge.** Return to Phase 2, integrate the new
   main, re-verify (new `VERIFIED_SHA`), then repeat this phase. This is the check that makes
   concurrent merges safe rather than merely discouraged.
2. If the root has been carrying the source branch, reattach it now - verification is done, so
   the branch no longer needs a working tree and `main` does:
   `node scripts/reattach-main.mjs --from-branch <branch> <root>`. It re-verifies every condition
   and switches only if they all hold; if it declines, STOP and report what it said.
3. `git merge --ff-only <branch>` from the main worktree. Git refuses if it is not a
   fast-forward; if it fails, STOP and report. A healthy run fast-forwards cleanly.
4. Confirm `git rev-parse main` equals `VERIFIED_SHA`. Do not push otherwise.
5. `git push origin main` (standing permission).

## Phase 5 - Finish

1. Confirm containment: `git branch --merged main` includes `<branch>`.
2. Remove every temporary worktree THIS run created, and only those - leaving one behind turns a
   merge into litter the next session mistakes for live work:

       git worktree remove .claude/worktrees/safe-merge-<slug>
       git worktree remove .claude/worktrees/safe-merge-main
       node scripts/dev-port.mjs --prune

   Run each line only for a worktree this run actually created. The prune only clears tickets
   whose worktree is gone, so it is safe unconditionally. Never `--force`: if a removal refuses,
   say so and leave it for the cleanup-worktrees workflow rather than overriding a refusal you did
   not diagnose. **Remove ONLY the worktrees this run created, and never the branch.** On Windows
   a removal routinely half-succeeds - git deregisters the worktree and then reports
   `Permission denied`, leaving an EMPTY directory. That is the known OS lock, not a refusal to
   override; `session-start.mjs` sweeps those anyway.
3. Do NOT remove any other worktree or delete the branch, and do not offer to.
4. Report: merged commits, verified sha now on `main`, which gate ran and its result, push
   result, temporary worktrees created and removed. If the queue had more `clear` branches,
   continue with the next one; if it stopped on a `caution`/`hold`, name the branch and why.
