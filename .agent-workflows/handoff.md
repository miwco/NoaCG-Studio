# handoff - end-of-session handoff

Shared canonical procedure for the `handoff` workflow - invoked as `/handoff` in Claude Code,
`$handoff` in Codex. Cross-references to other workflows below use their plain names (e.g.
"the safe-merge workflow"); translate as `/safe-merge` in Claude Code, `$safe-merge` in Codex.

End-of-session handoff for **NoaCG Studio**. Usually run right after the safe-merge workflow,
so the work is typically already committed, merged, pushed, and validated. Do NOT redo that
work.

Optional focus from the user, if one was given at invocation.

## Output

**The question this workflow answers is "what should be done next, and why is it worth doing?"**
Everything else is optional weight. No "what happened" summary, no hygiene checklist, no
validation status section, no mention of other branches or worktrees (the user prunes those
deliberately, in their own sessions).

**Self-check before writing: every claim is checked against evidence, and anything unbacked is
flagged.** A number is checked against the measurement it came from; "works", "landed" or
"green" against the run that showed it; a claim the session cannot back is written as
UNVERIFIED, never rounded up. A handoff that overclaims poisons the next session's plan and
costs the owner the re-checking this workflow exists to remove.

### 1. What's next

A short list, best next step first. Concrete enough to act on without re-reading the chat.
Scope it to THIS session's line of work - never "go merge branch X". Include:

- **Unfinished work known only from this chat** - a half-done feature, a bug found but not
  fixed, a design agreed but not built, a decision deferred. This is the most valuable line in
  the output: git cannot reconstruct it and archiving the chat destroys it.
- **A blocking step the work implies** - a `supabase/` migration, a `VITE_*` env var, a
  `render-worker`/`player-host` rebuild, a nested `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` or `docs/GOALS.md`
  now wrong.
- **Optional follow-ups**, clearly marked as optional so they are easy to skip.

**Every item carries its WHY - the real problem it solves, or the goal it serves.** One clause
is enough: the defect it fixes, the user it unblocks, or the section of `docs/GOALS.md` it moves.
A next step is a CLAIM that doing it changes something real, and the session that picks it up has
to be able to TEST that claim rather than obey it. Nothing here is work because it is on a list -
a reader who judges that an item will not reach the goal is right to say so and skip it, and that
judgement is only possible when the why is on the page. An item whose why cannot be written down
is not a next step; drop it rather than dressing it up.

Prefer the honest small why to the grand one. "The export door is untested on real hardware and
the class runs on it" is useful. "Improves quality" is not a why.

If there is genuinely nothing to do next, say so in one line. Don't invent work.

### 2. Pasteable prompt - only if work remains

A single self-contained code block for a fresh Claude Code or Codex session: what was
completed, repo/branch state if it matters, the remaining work **and why each piece matters**,
key constraints or decisions (point at the right nested `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`), known risks,
the best next step. No transcript dump. The block must stand alone - the user pastes it and
nothing else, so anything the next session needs is inside it.

When work remains, include the exact current branch and short HEAD, whether the working tree is
clean, and the last known verification command/result tied to that commit. If verification is
missing or stale, say so as remaining work rather than running it during handoff.

Four fields that cost one line each and are expensive to reconstruct once this chat is gone:

- **Landed or not, as a fact** - whether the work reached `main` and `origin/main`, stated
  plainly rather than in prose. A session whose story says "all merged" can still be holding
  uncommitted work in its own worktree, and a reader cannot tell those apart from a summary.
- **The files this branch touched** - `git diff --name-only main...HEAD`, about a dozen at most
  with a count if there are more. Once the branch is merged this is the one input nobody can
  recover, and it is what a check for two parallel sessions editing one file runs on. That
  collision is the expensive one: git merges both edits cleanly and produces a tree describing
  something neither session built.
- **What this blocks, and what blocked it** - one line. This session knows it for free; anyone
  planning around it otherwise has to read source to work it out.
- **Constraints: point, don't reprint.** A rule already written in a repo file gets a POINTER
  naming that file. Print only what exists nowhere but this chat - a measured finding, an option
  ruled out and why, a trap that cost this session real time. Copying an area's `AGENTS.md` into
  the prompt is how these get fat, and the copy goes stale while the file it came from does not.

Skip this section entirely when nothing remains - don't pad it out to look complete.

### 3. Bottom line

One or two lines, last. **This is a TEST, not an impression.** Archive-ready means the work is
committed, pushed, and contained in `main`; nothing less qualifies, however finished the session
feels. Run the checks, then lead with exactly one of these, verbatim, followed by why in plain
language:

- `SAFE TO ARCHIVE` - all four hold: the working tree is clean, there is no mid-merge/rebase
  state and no stash holding this work, `git merge-base --is-ancestor HEAD main` exits 0, and
  `git merge-base --is-ancestor HEAD origin/main` exits 0. The normal state after a clean run of
  the safe-merge workflow.
- `SAFE TO ARCHIVE WITH NOTES` - the same four hold, and there are follow-ups captured in the
  prompt above. The verdict answers whether closing the chat LOSES anything, and a follow-up
  written down is not a loss.
- `NOT SAFE TO ARCHIVE YET` - anything else, **including every case where the answer is merely
  unproven**. Uncommitted or unpushed changes, an untracked file worth keeping, work that should
  have landed on `main` but did not, a required migration or env step, or an unfinished task known
  only here. Say in one line exactly what to do first.

Two ways this verdict goes wrong, so test for both. A green, verified FEATURE branch is **not**
archive-ready - the work is real but it lives in exactly one place, and this chat is the only
thing that knows why it was done that way. And `origin/main` is a LOCAL ref: if it looks behind,
confirm before claiming the work was pushed - a read-only `git fetch origin main` is the one
network read this workflow may make. When containment cannot be established, the verdict is
`NOT SAFE TO ARCHIVE YET`, never the optimistic guess.

## How to ground it (read-only)

Do this work for yourself - almost none of it reaches the response. Run the checks; don't print
commands for the user to run.

- **Where am I** - `git branch --show-current`, `git worktree list`, `git rev-parse --short HEAD`.
  Never ASSUME where `main` is; inspect every registered worktree and expect both `claude/*`
  and `codex/*` feature branches.
- **What's outstanding** - `git status --porcelain=v1 --branch`, untracked files worth keeping
  (`git ls-files --others --exclude-standard`), `git stash list`, any mid-merge/rebase state, and
  whether the work actually reached `main`/`origin/main` when the session's story says it did.
- **Validation** - reuse existing evidence: a `npm run build` already run, the safe-merge
  workflow's gate, any `e2e/` or in-browser check already done. `npm run build` (tsc + eslint +
  vite) is the gate; focused script tests may also apply. Do not run verification during
  handoff. If code changed after the last check, record verification as the next required action.

A finding reaches the response only if it is actionable, and then it belongs in the prompt as
remaining work. If the answer is the boring expected one, say nothing.

## Rules

- **Read, don't write.** Never merge, push, commit, delete, clean, stash, reset, or rewrite
  history, run builds, or execute tests. Report problems; never silently fix them.
- **Say nothing about worktree cleanup** - not whether this worktree could be removed, not what
  removal would destroy, not that the option exists. The owner asked for that noise to stay out of
  a handoff, and the cleanup-worktrees workflow now decides eligibility itself from containment
  and archives whatever it cannot rebuild, so a handoff has nothing to add to it. Never remove a
  worktree, and never offer to.
- **Create or update no files** - no handoff file, session summary, timestamped note, project
  document, or tool-specific memory. Deliver all continuation context in the response so the same
  handoff works in Claude Code and Codex. The one exception is a WAVE session whose starting
  prompt names a handoff file under `docs/handoffs/`: that file is the channel the next
  orchestrator reads, and the prompt's instruction outranks this rule - write the file the
  prompt names (before queueing, so it lands with the work); this workflow's response is then
  the human-facing copy of the same content.
- **Be fast enough to use after every session.**
