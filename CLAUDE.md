# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for AI agents working in this repo. Keep it accurate — update it when architecture or
conventions change.

## What this is

An **AI-assisted, SPX-first** browser tool for building HTML broadcast graphics and exporting them
as working **SPX** templates (SPX Graphics / CasparCG). The primary UX is **choose-first,
learn-after**: the creation wizard builds the graphic from choices (template → fields → style →
animation) and writes simple, commented code the user then reads, learns from, and edits. Code
remains the single source of truth — Monaco always shows it, the live panels patch it
deterministically, and nothing hides behind visual-only tools.

Binding project docs (read before generating or judging templates): **`docs/DESIGN_LANGUAGE.md`**
(taste + motion + code-style rules) and **`docs/GOALS.md`** (north star + milestone checklist —
keep it checked off as work lands).

**The pillars (keep every change true to these):**
- **AI-assisted** — AI and blocks help write the template, but the human stays in control of the code.
- **SPX-first** — the target is a working SPX template; SPX compatibility comes before everything.
- **Code stays visible** — the real HTML/CSS/JS is always shown and editable. **Never hide the graphic
  behind visual-only tools**; any visual/AI action must write code the user can see.
- **Simple, teachable code** — generated code is clean, commented, and beginner-friendly.
- **Reliable export** — an SPX package must always be valid and plug-and-play (see the validation gate).

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # Vite dev server on http://localhost:5174
npm run build    # tsc (typecheck) && vite build -> dist/   <-- run this after changes; it's the CI gate
npm run preview  # serve the production build
```

There is **no unit-test suite**. Verify changes with `npm run build` plus in-browser checks (see
Verifying, below). Never mark work done on a green build alone if behaviour is observable — check it.

## Non-negotiable principles (these override default behaviour)

1. **Code is the single source of truth.** `SpxTemplate` (html/css/js + parsed definition) is
   canonical. Visual/AI/block actions must emit *deterministic, readable code patches*, never a
   hidden scene model. The editor always reflects exactly what was written.
2. **Generated code must be clean, commented, and beginner-friendly.** These templates teach. Prefer
   simple, obvious code over clever code. Rich-but-commented CSS is the house style.
3. **Offline-first, no unnecessary dependencies.** GSAP is bundled locally
   (`src/assets/gsap.min.js`). Don't add runtime deps or external/CDN references in generated
   templates. The exported package must be plug-and-play (relative paths, bundled GSAP).
4. **Validate before export.** `validation/validateTemplate.ts` is the gate; export is blocked on
   errors. Keep it authoritative — the platform owns SPX compatibility, not the AI.
5. **Building blocks and AI are deterministic transforms** `(template) => template` that insert
   clean code. No fragile free-form generation in the stub path.

## SPX template format (the contract)

Full reference: **`docs/SPX_TEMPLATE_FORMAT.md`** (derived from the real examples in
`example_projects/`). Essentials:

- A global `window.SPXGCTemplateDefinition = { ...settings, DataFields: [...] }` describes the
  operator's fields. Fields are `f0`, `f1`, … with an `ftype` (textfield, number, dropdown, …).
- SPX calls global `play()`, `stop()`, `update(data)` (a **JSON string**), and `next(data)`.
- **Field → DOM convention (this project): each field `fN` maps to one element `id="fN"`.**
  `update()` writes the value straight into it via `getElementById`. **No hidden `.spx-data`
  holders, no `_gfx` display split** — that older "premium pack" style is documented but not what we
  generate. An input-only value (e.g. a countdown duration) may live in a hidden `<div id="fN"
  style="display:none">`.

### The choose-first creation flow (primary UX)

New projects go through the **CreationWizard** (Entry → Category → Template → Fields → Style →
Animation, persistent live preview). Creating calls `variant.create(options)` which generates the
complete, commented template. After creation, code is the source of truth and two **live panels**
keep working via deterministic patches:

- **Style panel** — reads/writes the `:root` style contract (`--accent`, `--text-color`,
  `--text-dim`, `--panel-bg`, `--font-heading`, `--scale`), swaps the marked `@font-face` block
  (bundled or imported), re-anchors the root element via `zoneDecls`, and can import a font
  post-creation.
- **Motion panel** — only touches the marked region
  (`/* == ANIMATION … == */ … /* == END ANIMATION == */`) and its three knob variables
  (`animSpeed`, `easeIn`, `easeOut`). Presets are per-category (`blocks/animPatch.ts
  presetsForType`); the root prefix is detected from `class="(\w+)-box"`. Preset/steps swaps
  re-emit the region (undoable); user code outside the markers is never modified. The steps
  toggle is hidden for end-credits/tickers (continuous formats).

**Easing doctrine** lives in `model/easings.ts` + DESIGN_LANGUAGE §4: entrances use Out-direction
curves, exits use In-direction and run faster; Back Out for pops; Bounce/Elastic playful-only;
Linear only for continuous motion (credits rolls, ticker marquees — strictly `ease: 'none'`).

**Broadcast packages.** Graphics made in one project must read as siblings — DESIGN_LANGUAGE §8
holds the per-family cross-category tokens (minimal / sport / glass shape, type, and motion
values). Two mechanisms enforce it: the **project brand** (`model/brand.ts`, captured on every
wizard Create; the wizard's "Match current project" toggle re-applies palette + font via
`brandPatch`) and **sibling judging** (every new category variant is judged against its
lower-third counterpart). Custom colors enter through the wizard's Custom palette (hex/rgba +
picker); imported fonts become template assets (`fonts/<file>` data-URL) with a visible
`@font-face`, are registered via the FontFace API for the builder UI, and ship as real binaries
in the export.

Key flows and patterns:

- **Editing:** `setHtml/setCss/setJs` update the template; editing HTML re-parses the definition so
  `fields`/`settings` stay in sync. Preview rebuilds on a ~350 ms debounce.
- **Building blocks** (`blocks/registry.ts`): pure transforms grouped by a hierarchical `path`
  (e.g. `['Lower third']`, `['Animation','GSAP']`) with a `primaryTab` (tab to reveal after
  applying). Inserted elements are positioned in the lower-left action-safe area via
  `positionForNewElement`, tagged `data-gfx`, and styled with `textCssRule` (rich commented CSS).
  Animation is two tracks: **CSS** (`@keyframes` + class applied to the element) and **GSAP**
  (tween injected into `play()/stop()`).
- **Undo:** `applyTemplate` snapshots the previous template; `undo()` restores it. Blocks, AI, and
  gallery all flow through `applyTemplate`. Global **Ctrl/Cmd+Z** (AppShell) calls `undo()` unless
  focus is in Monaco or a form field.
- **Assets/branding:** uploads are base64 data URLs in `template.assets[]`; the preview inlines
  them, the exporter decodes them to real files under `assets/`. Brand colours are `:root` CSS
  variables.
- **Teaching:** `teach/cssReference.ts` is the single catalog powering both the Learn-tab reference
  (with MDN deep-links) and the Blocks "suggested property" chips (which call
  `setCssDeclaration`).

## Verifying changes

Always `npm run build` (typecheck + build) after changes.

- **UI flows → use Playwright.** Verify user-facing flows with the E2E suite in `e2e/` (specs drive
  the real dev server). Run `npm run test:e2e`. Add a spec for any new user-facing flow (gallery,
  blocks, undo, guides, branding, export, …).
- **Logic checks without UI (fast path):** Vite serves source modules, so in a browser context you
  can `await import('/src/blocks/registry.ts?t=' + Date.now())`, apply blocks to
  `createBlankTemplate(...)`, run `validateTemplate`, and load `composeDocument(tpl)` into a hidden
  iframe to call `update()/play()/stop()`. Good for blocks, templates, validation, and export logic.
- **Store/state checks:** `import('/src/store/templateStore.ts')` then `useTemplateStore.getState()`.
- **Template catalog sweep:** `node scripts/l3-sweep.mjs <shots-dir> <category>` (dev server must
  be running; category = `lower-third` | `info-card` | `end-credits` | `ticker`) — validates every
  variant × preset × easing (runtime, steps, auto-fit, credits/ticker track checks) and captures
  settled-state taste screenshots. Run it for the affected category after template changes.

**Gotchas:**
- After many edits the Vite dev server can serve a **stale module** (HMR lag) — restart it if a
  change isn't reflected.
- Worse: after HMR updates, `import('/src/store/…')` in an eval/console context can resolve a
  **different module instance** than the running app (a "ghost store" — your clicks patch the real
  store while your assertions read the stale one). If state reads disagree with visible UI,
  **restart the dev server and reload** before trusting any eval-based assertion.
- Monaco isn't fully interactive in a headless preview and GSAP animations don't visibly tick (rAF);
  assert on DOM/state, not screenshots, for those.
- In Playwright specs, **never clear localStorage via `addInitScript`** — the script also runs in
  the same-origin srcdoc preview iframe, so every preview rebuild wipes the key (this silently
  deleted the project brand). Fresh browser contexts already isolate storage per test.
- The preview rebuilds on a ~350 ms debounce after `applyTemplate` — Playwright specs must wait for
  it (or for an element unique to the new document) before clicking Play or asserting inside the
  iframe, or they hit the previous document.

## Git

- Work happens on `main` (the old feature branches were merged and deleted). Only branch if the user
  asks.
- The working rhythm in this repo: **commit each completed, verified phase/step** with a descriptive
  message. **Never add a `Co-Authored-By` trailer or any agent co-author** (the user's global rule).
  The user likes GitHub kept up to date, but ask before pushing unless they've already asked in the
  current effort.
- Don't commit `dist/` changes as part of feature work.
