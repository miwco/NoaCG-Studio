Guidance for AI agents working in this repo. Keep it accurate — update it when architecture or
conventions change.

## What this is

**NoaCG Studio** — an **AI-assisted, multi-platform** browser tool for creating modern, premium HTML
broadcast graphics and exporting them to **many broadcast/streaming environments** (SPX Graphics,
CasparCG, OGraf today; **OBS, vMix and more over time** — "anything-goes export"). SPX remains the
**canonical internal template format** and the strictest validation target; other targets are export
adapters derived from that same source. (Brand: dark control-room aesthetic, one amber "on-air" accent,
restrained glow; full system in `NoaCG-Brand-Kit/BRAND-MANUAL.md`.) The aim is to be **the best and
most useful place to create broadcast graphics, and run them anywhere** — for organizations, TV
channels, streamers, and universities, technical and non-technical users alike (it's also used in
teaching, but the product is a production tool, not a code tutorial). **Business posture: free forever
for the core; the only paid surface is hosted AI without a BYO key; the current goal is users/adoption,
not revenue** (see `docs/GOALS.md` operating principles). The creation wizard builds a graphic from
choices (template → fields → style → animation): a **non-technical user never has to open the code**,
while a **professional** can drop into the always-available editor and take full control. Code stays
the single source of truth — the live panels patch it deterministically and nothing hides behind
visual-only tools — but its *view* is optional (the code editor can be hidden).

Binding project docs (read before generating or judging templates): **`docs/DESIGN_LANGUAGE.md`**
(taste + motion + code-style rules) and **`docs/GOALS.md`** (north star + milestone checklist —
keep it checked off as work lands).

**The pillars (keep every change true to these):**
- **Best & easiest to create** — the north star is premium output with the least friction; a
  non-technical user can make a great graphic without ever touching code.
- **AI-assisted** — AI and blocks help write the template; a pro stays in full control of the code.
- **Export anywhere, SPX-canonical** — the ambition is a platform that runs graphics in many
  environments (SPX, OBS, vMix, CasparCG, OGraf, and more). SPX is the canonical *internal* template
  format and the strictest validation target; every other target is an export adapter off the same
  source, so breadth is added without reworking the core. SPX compatibility stays rock-solid, but the
  product is not "an SPX generator."
- **Code is real & always available, view optional** — every visual/AI action writes real HTML/CSS/JS
  you can open and edit; **nothing hides behind a visual-only scene model**. But the code *view* is
  optional: no-code users keep it hidden, pros work in it directly.
- **Clean, editable code** — generated code is clean and commented so a professional can read and extend it.
- **Reliable export** — an SPX package must always be valid and plug-and-play (see the validation gate).

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # Vite dev server (landing at /, THE EDITOR AT /app)
npm run build    # tsc (typecheck) && vite build -> dist/   <-- run this after changes; it's the CI gate
npm run preview  # serve the production build
```

**The dev port is per-checkout** (`scripts/dev-port.mjs`): 5174 in the main checkout (5175 for
the live e2e suite), a stable path-derived port in a linked git worktree — so parallel worktrees
never fight over one server. Vite (strictPort), both Playwright configs, and the dev scripts all
derive the same number; `node scripts/dev-port.mjs` prints it. `.claude/launch.json` is
GENERATED with that port by postinstall (gitignored — never hand-edit or commit it).
`DEV_PORT=n` overrides everything if two worktrees ever hash to the same port.

**Two pages (Vite MPA):** `index.html` is the static public landing at `/` (no React; carries a
redirect shim so old root `?chat=`/`?template=` share links land on `/app` with their query).
`app.html` is the editor at `/app` — dev/preview get the clean URL from the `app-clean-url`
plugin in vite.config.ts; production gets it from Vercel `cleanUrls` (vercel.json). E2E specs
navigate to `/app`.

There is **no unit-test suite**. Verify changes with `npm run build` plus in-browser checks (see
Verifying, below). Never mark work done on a green build alone if behaviour is observable — check it.

## Non-negotiable principles (these override default behaviour)

1. **Code is the single source of truth.** `SpxTemplate` (html/css/js + parsed definition) is
   canonical. Visual/AI/block actions must emit *deterministic, readable code patches*, never a
   hidden scene model. The editor always reflects exactly what was written.
2. **Generated code must be clean, commented, and easy to edit.** Prefer simple, obvious code over
   clever code — a professional should be able to read and extend it. Rich-but-commented CSS is the
   house style.
3. **Offline-first, no unnecessary dependencies.** GSAP is bundled locally
   (`src/assets/gsap.min.js`). Don't add runtime deps or external/CDN references in generated
   templates. The exported package must be plug-and-play (relative paths, bundled GSAP).
4. **Validate before export.** `validation/validateTemplate.ts` is the gate; export is blocked on
   errors. Keep it authoritative — the platform owns SPX compatibility, not the AI.
5. **Building blocks and AI are deterministic transforms** `(template) => template` that insert
   clean code. No fragile free-form generation in the stub path.

## SPX template format (the contract)

Full reference: **`docs/SPX_TEMPLATE_FORMAT.md`** (derived from the real examples in
`example_projects/`). Essentials:

- A global `window.SPXGCTemplateDefinition = { ...settings, DataFields: [...] }` describes the
  operator's fields. Fields are `f0`, `f1`, … with an `ftype` (textfield, number, dropdown, …).
- SPX calls global `play()`, `stop()`, `update(data)` (a **JSON string**), and `next(data)`.
- **Field → DOM convention (this project): each field `fN` maps to one element `id="fN"`.**
  `update()` writes the value straight into it via `getElementById`. **No hidden `.spx-data`
  holders, no `_gfx` display split** — that older "premium pack" style is documented but not what we
  generate. An input-only value (e.g. a countdown duration) may live in a hidden `<div id="fN"
  style="display:none">`.

### Auth posture (Era 5.6 — the open editor)

**There is no login wall, ever.** The editor — create, preview, export, local packets — is open to
everyone, hosted or self-hosted. Only *account features* gate themselves: cloud sync, community,
show chat, and AI (hosted mode). The pattern: read `useAuthState().needsSignIn` (true only when a
backend is configured AND the visitor is signed out) and render `SignInPrompt` / call
`useAuthUi().openSignIn(reason)` — never block the app. Offline builds (no Supabase env) must grow
**zero** auth UI (E2E-pinned in `e2e/auth.spec.ts`). Signup is OPEN (migration `0006` made the
Before-User-Created hook permissive; restore the 0002 function body to re-close it to the
allowlist). Don't reintroduce an app-wide gate.

### The choose-first creation flow (primary UX)

New projects go through the **CreationWizard** (Entry → Category → Template → Fields → Style →
Animation, persistent live preview). Creating calls `variant.create(options)` which generates the
complete, commented template. After creation, code is the source of truth and two **live panels**
keep working via deterministic patches:

- **Style panel** — reads/writes the `:root` style contract (`--accent`, `--text-color`,
  `--text-dim`, `--panel-bg`, `--font-heading`, `--scale`), swaps the marked `@font-face` block
  (bundled or imported), re-anchors the root element via `zoneDecls`, and can import a font
  post-creation.
- **Motion panel** — only touches the marked region
  (`/* == ANIMATION … == */ … /* == END ANIMATION == */`) and its three knob variables
  (`animSpeed`, `easeIn`, `easeOut`). Presets are per-category (`blocks/animPatch.ts
  presetsForType`); the root prefix is detected via `model/structure.ts` (hyphen-safe). Preset/steps swaps
  re-emit the region (undoable); user code outside the markers is never modified. The steps
  toggle only shows for line-based categories (lower thirds, info cards, scoreboards, corner
  bug) — continuous, clock, and data-driven formats hide it.

**Sample data on create:** `applyTemplate(template, { resetSampleData: true })` is used by the
wizard so a new project starts from ITS field defaults — plain `applyTemplate` (blocks, panels,
AI) intentionally preserves typed sample values for matching field ids. Don't drop the flag from
the wizard path: the old template's values would leak into the new graphic's fields.

**Template runtime rule:** generated template.js loads in `<head>` in exported packages — any
load-time DOM work (initial rebuild/paint) must use the DOM-ready guard pattern (see
shared/clock.ts or the rebuild calls in credits/tickers/infographics runtimes).

**Images & fields (the broadcast field policy):**
- Field types offered to users are the ones live graphics actually use: `textfield`,
  `textarea`, `number`, and **`filelist` = the image field** (SPX lists files from
  `assetfolder: './images/'`). `dropdown`/`checkbox`/`color` exist in the SPX format but are
  reserved for genuinely constrained design choices (e.g. the quiz's correct-answer dropdown) —
  don't offer them in generic field UIs.
- Asset path convention: uploads land at `images/<file>` (fonts at `fonts/<file>`); the export
  zip wraps everything in one project folder, so extracting into a templates folder yields
  `[TemplatesFolder]/<project>/index.html` + `<project>/images/<file>` — the layout SPX and
  CasparCG expect. Both exporters use `zip.folder(slug(name))`.
- Every runtime writes fields through the shared `setFieldValue` helper (base.ts
  `setFieldValueJs`): text -> textContent, `<img id="fN">` -> src (empty value hides the img and
  toggles `.has-image` on its parent so CSS can show a placeholder). Data-driven categories may
  instead keep the path in a hidden source div (credits' #f2 logo).
- Logo slots are real SPX fields: credits f2, corner bug + card03 design-owned `extraFields`
  (`StandardDesign.extraFields`, id computed after all user fields).
- The preview iframe can't resolve `images/...` set at runtime — composeDocument injects a
  MutationObserver shim that swaps known relative paths for their in-memory data URLs.
  Exported packages never include the shim.

**Easing doctrine** lives in `model/easings.ts` + DESIGN_LANGUAGE §4: entrances use Out-direction
curves, exits use In-direction and run faster; Back Out for pops; Bounce/Elastic playful-only;
Linear only for continuous motion (credits rolls, ticker marquees — strictly `ease: 'none'`).

**Broadcast packages.** Graphics made in one project must read as siblings — DESIGN_LANGUAGE §8
holds the per-family cross-category tokens (minimal / sport / glass / **noacg house** shape, type,
and motion values; noacg is the product's own on-air look, rebuilt from the brand-kit overlays). Two mechanisms enforce it: the **project brand** (`model/brand.ts`, captured on every
wizard Create; the wizard's "Use current project's colors & font" toggle — off by default —
re-applies palette + font via `brandPatch`) and **sibling judging** (every new category variant is judged against its
lower-third counterpart). Custom colors enter through the wizard's Custom palette (hex/rgba +
picker); imported fonts become template assets (`fonts/<file>` data-URL) with a visible
`@font-face`, are registered via the FontFace API for the builder UI, and ship as real binaries
in the export.

Key flows and patterns:

- **Editing:** `setHtml/setCss/setJs` update the template; editing HTML re-parses the definition so
  `fields`/`settings` stay in sync. Preview rebuilds on a ~350 ms debounce.
- **Building blocks** (`blocks/registry.ts`): pure transforms grouped by a hierarchical `path`
  (e.g. `['Lower third']`, `['Animation','GSAP']`) with a `primaryTab` (tab to reveal after
  applying). Inserted elements are positioned in the lower-left action-safe area via
  `positionForNewElement`, tagged `data-gfx`, and styled with `textCssRule` (rich commented CSS).
  Animation is two tracks: **CSS** (`@keyframes` + class applied to the element) and **GSAP**
  (tween injected into `play()/stop()`).
- **Undo:** `applyTemplate` snapshots the previous template; `undo()` restores it. Blocks, AI, and
  gallery all flow through `applyTemplate`. Global **Ctrl/Cmd+Z** (AppShell) calls `undo()` unless
  focus is in Monaco or a form field.
- **Assets/branding:** uploads are base64 data URLs in `template.assets[]`; the preview inlines
  them, the exporter decodes them to real files under `assets/`. Brand colours are `:root` CSS
  variables.
- **Editor hover help (optional):** the `teach/` module surfaces explanations as Monaco hover
  tooltips for users who open the code — an aid, not the point. There is no Learn tab.

## Verifying changes

Always `npm run build` (typecheck + build) after changes.

- **UI flows → use Playwright.** Verify user-facing flows with the E2E suite in `e2e/` (specs drive
  the real dev server). Run `npm run test:e2e`. Add a spec for any new user-facing flow (gallery,
  blocks, undo, guides, branding, export, …).
- **Logic checks without UI (fast path):** Vite serves source modules, so in a browser context you
  can `await import('/src/blocks/registry.ts?t=' + Date.now())`, apply blocks to
  `createBlankTemplate(...)`, run `validateTemplate`, and load `composeDocument(tpl)` into a hidden
  iframe to call `update()/play()/stop()`. Good for blocks, templates, validation, and export logic.
- **Store/state checks:** `import('/src/store/templateStore.ts')` then `useTemplateStore.getState()`.
- **Template catalog sweep:** `node scripts/l3-sweep.mjs <shots-dir> <category>` (dev server must
  be running; category = `lower-third` | `info-card` | `end-credits` | `ticker`) — validates every
  variant × preset × easing (runtime, steps, auto-fit, credits/ticker track checks) and captures
  settled-state taste screenshots. Run it for the affected category after template changes.

**Gotchas:**
- After many edits the Vite dev server can serve a **stale module** (HMR lag) — restart it if a
  change isn't reflected.
- The e2e suite pins **offline mode** via `webServer.env` in playwright.config.ts, but
  `reuseExistingServer: true` means a dev server already running on THIS checkout's port
  (started by hand, with the real `.env`) gets reused — backend-sensitive specs then fail
  confusingly. Kill any manual server on this checkout's port (`node scripts/dev-port.mjs`
  prints it) before `npm run test:e2e`. Other worktrees' servers are harmless — they live on
  their own ports.
- Worse: after HMR updates, `import('/src/store/…')` in an eval/console context can resolve a
  **different module instance** than the running app (a "ghost store" — your clicks patch the real
  store while your assertions read the stale one). If state reads disagree with visible UI,
  **restart the dev server and reload** before trusting any eval-based assertion.
- Monaco isn't fully interactive in a headless preview and GSAP animations don't visibly tick (rAF);
  assert on DOM/state, not screenshots, for those.
- In Playwright specs, **never clear localStorage via `addInitScript`** — the script also runs in
  the same-origin srcdoc preview iframe, so every preview rebuild wipes the key (this silently
  deleted the project brand). Fresh browser contexts already isolate storage per test.
- The preview rebuilds on a ~350 ms debounce after `applyTemplate` — Playwright specs must wait for
  it (or for an element unique to the new document) before clicking Play or asserting inside the
  iframe, or they hit the previous document.

## Git

- Work happens on `main` (the old feature branches were merged and deleted). Only branch if the user
  asks.
- The working rhythm in this repo: **commit each completed, verified phase/step** with a descriptive
  message. **Never add a `Co-Authored-By` trailer or any agent co-author** (the user's global rule).
  The user likes GitHub kept up to date: push completed, verified work to `main` without asking
  (standing permission, 2026-07-08).
- **Commit messages:** write clear, human-readable messages that explain the actual change — they
  must be understandable to any outside developer reading the history cold. No chat/session
  language, internal planning names, or AI-sounding phrases ("as requested", "starting era 5",
  "continued work", "made changes", "AI update", "per your instructions"). Never mention Claude,
  Codex, ChatGPT, agents, prompts, or the conversation unless the commit is specifically about AI
  tooling.
- Don't commit `dist/` changes as part of feature work.
