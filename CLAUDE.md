# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for AI agents working in this repo. Keep it accurate - update it when architecture or
conventions change. This root file holds the product identity, the non-negotiables, and the working
practices; **deep per-area contracts live in nested CLAUDE.md files** (directories marked * in the
map below) - read the relevant one before editing that area from outside it.

Be concise with all of your responses.

## What this is

**NoaCG Studio** - an **AI-assisted, multi-platform** browser tool for creating modern, premium
HTML broadcast graphics and exporting them to **many broadcast/streaming environments**
("anything-goes export": SPX Graphics, CasparCG, OGraf, OBS/vMix overlays today; more over time).
For TV channels, streamers, organizations, and universities, technical and non-technical users
alike - it's used in teaching, but it is a production tool, not a code tutorial. Brand: dark
control-room, one amber "on-air" accent, restrained glow (`NoaCG-Brand-Kit/BRAND-MANUAL.md`).
**Free forever for the core; the only paid surface is hosted AI without a BYO key; the current
goal is users/adoption, not revenue.** Binding docs, read before generating or judging templates:
**`docs/DESIGN_LANGUAGE.md`** (taste + motion + code style) and **`docs/GOALS.md`** (north star +
milestones - keep it checked off as work lands).

**The pillars (keep every change true to these):**
- **Best & easiest to create** - premium output with the least friction; a non-technical user can
  make a great graphic without ever touching code. **AI-assisted**, but a pro keeps full control.
- **Export anywhere, SPX-canonical** - SPX is the canonical *internal* format and the strictest
  validation target; every other target is an adapter off the same source. SPX compatibility stays
  rock-solid, but the product is not "an SPX generator."
- **Code is real & always available, view optional** - every visual/AI action writes real
  HTML/CSS/JS; **nothing hides behind a visual-only scene model**. No-code users keep the view
  hidden, pros work in it. Generated code is clean and commented; exports are always plug-and-play.

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # Vite dev server (landing at /, THE EDITOR AT /app)
npm run build    # tsc && eslint && vite build -> dist/   <-- run after changes; it's the CI gate
npm run lint     # eslint . --max-warnings 0 (also part of build)
```

**The dev port is per-checkout** (`scripts/dev-port.mjs`, which prints it): 5174 in the main
checkout (5175 for the live e2e suite), a RESERVED port from the 5180-5298 block in a linked
worktree - Vite, both Playwright configs, the guard hooks and the dev scripts all read the same
number, so parallel worktrees never fight over one server. The number is preferred by a hash of
the checkout path and then reserved through a ticket in `<git-common-dir>/noacg-dev-ports/`, so
two worktrees that hash alike still both start (**`docs/DEV_PORTS.md`** - assignment, storage,
troubleshooting a stuck server). `.claude/launch.json` and `.claude/dev-port.json` are GENERATED
from that reservation (gitignored - never hand-edit or commit them). `DEV_PORT=n` overrides
everything. `npm run test:ports` covers the allocator.

**Two pages (Vite MPA):** `index.html` is the static landing at `/` (no React; carries a redirect
shim so old root `?chat=`/`?template=` share links land on `/app` with their query); `app.html` is
the editor at `/app` (clean URL from the `app-clean-url` plugin in dev/preview, Vercel `cleanUrls`
in production). E2E specs navigate to `/app`.

There is **no unit-test suite**. Verify with `npm run build` plus in-browser checks (below); never
mark work done on a green build alone if the behaviour is observable.

## Non-negotiable principles (these override default behaviour)

1. **Code is the single source of truth.** `SpxTemplate` (html/css/js + parsed definition) is
   canonical. Visual/AI/block actions emit *deterministic, readable code patches*, never a hidden
   scene model; the editor always reflects exactly what was written.
2. **Generated code must be clean, commented, and easy to edit.** Prefer simple, obvious code over
   clever code; rich-but-commented CSS is the house style.
3. **Offline-first, no unnecessary dependencies.** GSAP is bundled locally
   (`src/assets/gsap.min.js`); so is the Lottie player (`src/assets/lottie.min.js`, lottie_light/
   MIT - injected only when the template uses a Lottie asset; detector in `assets/lottieSupport.ts`).
   No runtime deps or CDN references in generated templates; exports use relative paths only.
4. **Validate before export.** `validation/validateTemplate.ts` is the gate; export is blocked on
   errors. Keep it authoritative - the platform owns SPX compatibility, not the AI.
5. **Blocks and AI are deterministic transforms** `(template) => template` inserting clean code.
6. **Every persisted format carries a version, and a breaking change ships its migration in the
   same commit.** The catalog is large and templates are saved documents, so a shape change
   without a migration is data loss. The pattern (`docs/STATE_MACHINE_SCHEMA.md` §5, implemented
   in `blocks/animData.ts` and `model/layout.ts`): additive optional fields never bump the
   version; a breaking change bumps it and migrates ON READ, normalizing so everything
   downstream sees one shape; serialization always writes the current version; an unknown
   version degrades honestly (read-only, never a crash), so an older build never eats newer data.

## SPX template format (the contract)

Full reference: **`docs/SPX_TEMPLATE_FORMAT.md`** (derived from `example_projects/`). Essentials:

- A global `window.SPXGCTemplateDefinition = { ...settings, DataFields: [...] }` describes the
  operator's fields. Fields are `f0`, `f1`, … with an `ftype` (textfield, number, dropdown, …).
- SPX calls global `play()`, `stop()`, `update(data)` (a **JSON string**), and `next(data)`.
- **Field -> DOM convention (this project): each field `fN` maps to one element `id="fN"`**, which
  `update()` writes into via `getElementById`. **No hidden `.spx-data` holders, no `_gfx` display
  split** - that older "premium pack" style is documented but not what we generate. An input-only
  value (e.g. a countdown duration) may live in a hidden `<div id="fN" style="display:none">`.

## The state-machine model (what a graphic IS)

Full reference: **`docs/STATE_MACHINE_SCHEMA.md`**. A graphic is data fields + one or more
PARALLEL state groups, all inside the one `NOACG_ANIM` data block (format version 2) in the
marked ANIMATION region - no second scene model, no parallel format. Essentials:

- A **state** is what the graphic looks like; its content is a timeline. A **transition** is an
  animated change, fired by an operator **event** or a **timer**. Guarding is STRUCTURAL - a
  transition fires only if the author drew that arrow from the current state. No expression
  language, ever.
- **The default path** is the ordered walk `next` follows - the SPX/CasparCG compatibility
  contract. Every template, however complex, degrades to dumb-stepping along it. `steps` IS that
  path: `defaultPath[i]`'s timeline is `steps[i]` (the positional binding), which is why the
  multi-step reveal feature became the default path rather than being duplicated by it.
- **Data updates never cause transitions.** `update()` writes fields; state changes come only
  from events (a payload may ride an accepted event, which is what makes a multi-part change
  atomic). **Parameterize with data, not states** - one `Selected` state plus a field, never
  four near-identical states.
- **Every state is enterable two ways:** by transition (animated) or by SNAP (instant - recovery,
  emergency jumps, preview without playback). **Reset is two operations**, never conflated: reset
  visual state (snap every group to its initial) and reset data.
- Events are processed SERIALLY through one queue per graphic, and that queue lives INSIDE the
  template - so the determinism holds identically in the editor, in an exported overlay, and
  under SPX.
- **Control pages are GENERATED from the machine** (docs/CONTROL_LAYER.md): every operator
  event becomes a button (labels/sections/payloads ride in the additive `machine.controls`
  metadata), every field an input, legality = the structural guard mirrored as greying.
  Staged data airs only on an explicit take; the event log is what makes refresh/crash
  recovery possible (data half, then snap - reset is two operations, recovery is both).
- A template with no `machine` key IS the implicit one-group linear machine, derived on read and
  never persisted: the whole existing catalog behaves exactly as before. A **graphic type**
  (`docs/GRAPHIC_TYPES.md`) follows the same rule - it persists a machine only when the derived
  one is wrong, which is why most types add nothing to what they emit.

## Architecture map

Directories marked * have their own CLAUDE.md with the binding per-area contracts. The
cross-domain rules - layers, allowed import edges, where new code goes, UI thinness, the
grandfathered-debt list - are binding in **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`**; a change that adds a
domain-to-domain edge updates that doc in the same PR.

               (never add allow-same-origin), postMessage with a per-session nonce
```

### Auth posture (the open editor)

**There is no login wall, ever.** The editor - create, preview, export, local packets - is open to
everyone, hosted or self-hosted. Only *account features* gate themselves: cloud sync, community,
show chat, and AI (hosted mode). Offline builds (no Supabase env) must grow **zero** auth UI
(E2E-pinned in `e2e/auth.spec.ts`). Don't reintroduce an app-wide gate; the `needsSignIn`/
`SignInPrompt` pattern lives in src/components/CLAUDE.md.

### The choose-first creation flow (primary UX)

New projects go through the **CreationWizard** (Entry -> Category -> Template -> Fields -> Style
-> Animation, persistent live preview); `variant.create(options)` generates the complete, commented
template, applied with `resetSampleData: true` so a project starts from its own field defaults.
The Entry step leads with **Continue working** (recent library graphics + the door to Home),
then the broadcast-graphics cards: templates, **"Create with AI"** (a brief plus optional images
and/or an existing .html/.zip - every AI result runs the harness with the runtime bench injected,
and the no-AI "Open as code" import stays one click away, never gated on sign-in),
**"Import graphic"** (manual: artwork -> erase/scale -> PLACE text fields -> fonts -> in/out
animation), and blank; **"Video or animation with AI"** sits in its own visually separated
strip marked Beta (the parallel VIDEO project kind, engine chosen at create - creating/opening
a video flips the persisted doc-kind switch and every SPX create path flips it back). After creation, code
is the source of truth and two **live panels** keep working via deterministic patches: the **Style
panel** writes the `:root` style contract and **the step timeline** touches ONLY the marked
ANIMATION region - user code outside the markers is never modified. The timeline dock picks its
surface from the CODE, never the category, which keeps pre-migration templates working.

## Verifying changes

Always `npm run build` (typecheck + lint + build) after changes. The tree stays lint-clean: fix
findings properly rather than sprinkling eslint-disable comments.

- **UI flows -> Playwright.** Verify user-facing flows with the E2E suite in `e2e/` (specs drive the
  real dev server): `npm run test:e2e`, and add a spec for any new flow. For the inner loop,
  `npm run test:e2e:affected` maps changed files to covering specs (`scripts/e2e-affected.mjs`) -
  the FULL suite is the merge gate. Bootstrap non-wizard specs with `createProject` (`e2e/_create.ts`).
- **Logic checks without UI (fast path):** Vite serves source modules, so in a browser context you
  can `await import('/src/blocks/registry.ts?t=' + Date.now())`, apply blocks to
  `createBlankTemplate(...)`, run `validateTemplate`, and load `composeDocument(tpl)` into a hidden
  iframe to call `update()/play()/stop()`; store state via `useTemplateStore.getState()`.
- **Template catalog sweep:** `node scripts/l3-sweep.mjs <shots-dir> <category>` (dev server must
  be running; `lower-third` | `info-card` | `end-credits` | `ticker`) - validates every variant ×
  preset × easing. Run it for the affected category after template changes.

**Gotchas:**
- The app declares `color-scheme: dark` (styles.css `:root`) and composeDocument injects the
  matching `<meta name="color-scheme" content="dark">` into the preview srcdoc. **Keep them
  paired** - Chromium paints an iframe opaque (white stage) when the schemes disagree.
- The e2e suite pins **offline mode** via `webServer.env`, but `reuseExistingServer: true` means a
  dev server already running on THIS checkout's port (started by hand, with the real `.env`) gets
  reused - backend-sensitive specs then fail confusingly. Kill any manual server on this
  checkout's port first. Other worktrees' servers are harmless.
- The dev server can serve a **stale module** after many edits (HMR lag) - restart it. Worse,
  `import('/src/store/…')` in an eval context can then resolve a **different module instance** than
  the running app (a "ghost store"): if state reads disagree with visible UI, restart and reload
  before trusting the assertion. Monaco also isn't fully interactive headless and GSAP doesn't
  visibly tick (rAF) - assert on DOM/state there.
- In Playwright specs, **never clear localStorage via `addInitScript`** - it also runs in the
  same-origin srcdoc preview iframe, so every rebuild wipes the key (this silently deleted the
  project brand). Fresh browser contexts already isolate storage per test.
- The preview rebuilds on a ~350 ms debounce after `applyTemplate` - never sleep it out. Use
  `awaitPreviewRebuild` (`e2e/_preview.ts`) before clicking Play or asserting inside the iframe,
  wrapping the action when anything slow sits between action and wait.
- **A spec that presses Space (or Enter) must first say where FOCUS is.** Clicking a control leaves
  it focused, and Space belongs to a focused button by design (spaceKey.ts) - so the press lands on
  that button, not on the surface under test. Which one answers can even depend on a timer the spec
  never mentions: a new field arrives selected and the Inspector's deferred reveal unmounts the
  Data tab's `+ Add` half a second later, dropping focus to the body. Call `parkFocusOffControls`
  (`e2e/_keys.ts`) rather than inheriting whatever the bootstrap left behind.
- A wizard-created VIDEO project auto-runs its first generation, which lands as its own undoable
  snapshot ~0.1-2.6 s after `video-shell` appears (unbounded: the validation probe waits on the
  player host with no timeout). A spec that makes an undoable change before that lands is racing
  it - the generation becomes the newest undo target, so a later Ctrl+Z rewinds the generation
  instead, and an assertion that the project did NOT change can pass vacuously. Wait for the
  assistant reply first (`waitForGeneration`, `.ai-msg.assistant`), never a fixed timeout.

## Git

- Most work happens on a **feature branch**, usually in a worktree - several are typically active
  at once. If a session starts on `main` with work to do, branch first. The rhythm: **commit each
  completed, verified phase/step** to the FEATURE BRANCH with a descriptive message. **Never add a
  `Co-Authored-By` trailer or any agent co-author.** Don't commit `dist/` in feature work.
- **`main` is only ever touched when the user asks for it, in that message - from ANY checkout.**
  Nothing lands on your own initiative: no commit made while sitting on `main`, no `git merge` into
  main, no `git push origin main`, no `safe-merge`. Being in the primary checkout on `main` is not
  permission to land - the user decides when work lands, *after* they know the change is safe.
  Commit verified work to the feature branch, report what you did and verified, and STOP.
- **Commit messages:** clear and human-readable, explaining the actual change - understandable to an
  outside developer reading the history cold. No chat/session language, internal planning names, or
  AI-sounding phrases ("as requested", "starting era 5", "continued work"). Never mention Claude,
  agents, prompts, or the conversation unless the commit is specifically about AI tooling.
