// WHAT IS ACTUALLY BROKEN IN A CI RUN, as a stable set and a stable hash.
//
//   node scripts/ci-failure-set.mjs --run <run-id> [--json]
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Two places need the same answer and neither could get it from a conclusion
// alone. `main is red` says nothing a person can act on; `main is red on e2e/anim-engine.spec.ts`
// sends them to the file. And "have we already said this?" cannot be answered by the commit sha -
// every landing is a new sha, which is exactly how one defect was reported 27 times in 35 hours
// (docs/CI_STABILITY.md, measured 2026-08-15..29).
//
// The set is built from the run's own CHECK ANNOTATIONS rather than from its logs. Playwright's
// `github` reporter (playwright.config.ts) emits one `::error file=<spec>` per failing test, so
// GitHub already holds the per-spec truth in a structured form; grepping a shard log for it would
// be a second, worse parser of the same fact.
//
// THE HASH FAILS OPEN. An empty or unreadable set hashes to `unknown`, and every caller treats
// `unknown` as "say it out loud" rather than "nothing to see". A dedup that silently swallows a
// failure it could not classify is worse than no dedup at all - the owner's constraint, verbatim
// on 2026-08-29: "it's fine to turn off any extra emails, but I do not want to close my eyes if we
// have problems".
