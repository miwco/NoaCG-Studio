// THE WAVE PLAN CHECK - is this wave-state file ready to launch from?
//
//   node scripts/wave-plan-check.mjs                 # the newest fresh plan in docs/handoffs/
//   node scripts/wave-plan-check.mjs --plan <path>
//   node scripts/wave-plan-check.mjs --json
//
// WHY. The orchestrator contract carried its readiness rules as prose - every row names its files,
// scarce slots are allocated once, every prompt ends on QUEUE, every handoff is classified, every
// path is confirmed - and each rule failed at least once in its first week without anything saying
// so at the moment it failed. Two of the failures were the kind a file diff cannot see: a row that
// named the wrong file (so two rows called disjoint were unanalysed), and ten rows that all went to
// one worker pool because no rule asked the planner to choose. This script asks. It reads the plan
// the orchestrator writes anyway (`docs/handoffs/<date>-<day|night>-wave-plan.local.md`) and
// refuses the shapes the contract forbids, so readiness is a verdict rather than a feeling.
//
// WHAT IT CHECKS, each a named problem in the output:
//   - a `## Wave table` with the columns L, goal, START, TOUCHES, MINTS, POOL, browser;
//   - letters unique; START one of `now`, `on <branch> landing`, `on slot free`;
//   - POOL from the vocabulary below, and a row on a non-Claude pool names its fallback;
//   - no scarce slot minted by two rows;
//   - every TOUCHES entry that looks like a path exists (or is marked `(new)`), globs by prefix;
//   - every letter has a prompt block opening `SESSION <L>` whose last keyword line is QUEUE;
//   - a `Pools at plan time:` line - the capacity snapshot the routing decision was made on;
//   - every tracked handoff file classified under `## Handoffs` (scripts/handoff-drain.mjs);
//   - every unstarted owner receipt mentioned by slug somewhere in the plan
//     (scripts/owner-receipts.mjs) - a plan may hold or defer one, never fail to see it.
//
// And it prints ECONOMY NOTES, which refuse nothing: a snapshot line that gives Claude a percentage
// it does not have, and Codex headroom left idle by a plan with no codex row (`economyNotes`).
//
// It judges nothing about whether the rows are the RIGHT rows; that stays the master's. It only
// refuses a plan whose shape hides a decision that was not made.
