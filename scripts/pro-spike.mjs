// THE BRAND ROUND (the default since Phase 1): every brief is conditioned on a SYNTHETIC
// brand from benchmarks/pro/v1/spike/brands.json - an invented organisation's name, palette,
// typeface and REAL mark file, the mark's shape/backing/ink measured in the page by probeMark
// before any call. The fixture's `assignment` fixes which brand each brief carries (so a round
// reproduces from committed fixtures alone) and its `divergence` cell re-runs two briefs under
// every OTHER brand on the no-exemplar arm - same brief, different brands, visibly different
// graphics is the round's second question. `--no-brand` runs the bare Phase 0 protocol.
// Records key by `<brief>.<brand>.<arm>`; the mark's rendered gate, the alignment-axis
// instrument and the code audit land on every record beside the validator verdict.
//
// THE CONTROL RUN IS THE POINT OF THE FIRST MODE. It pushes one known-good hand-authored
// lower third - plus the gallery's anchors - through the COMPLETE wrapper: the scaffold
// contract, the deterministic gates, the 1920x1080 render set, the virtual-clock motion
// strips, and the gallery. It spends nothing and calls no model. If the control looks
// broken, the harness is broken, and a paid round would measure the harness. The strips are
// PLAYED as well as laid out - each one is encoded to a webm the gallery loops in place, because
// stills cannot judge motion (owner, after the brand round). ffmpeg is optional; without it the
// gallery falls back to stills. Two paid rounds
// have already been mis-read as model failure when the platform was at fault
// (docs/AI_ATTEMPTS.md), and every deterministic gate stayed green through both - which is
// why this is a picture a human looks at, not an assertion.
//
// THE RUN PROTOCOL (§0.1): the 12-brief bank, every brief in the requested arms (two or three
// hand-vetted complete exemplars retrieved through shortlistFor / no exemplars at all / the
// region GRAMMAR LESSON in their place, src/ai/spike/grammar.ts), one
// candidate each, one or at most two pinned open-weight checkpoints, decoding pinned in
// benchmarks/pro/v1/spike/decoding.json, the shared two-round repair loop,
// productionSpxValidator, composeDocument at 1920x1080, and an ANCHOR-MIXED BLINDED gallery.
//
// THE GALLERY IS BLIND ON PURPOSE (§0.2). review.html shows opaque ids and no verdict, no
// arm and no checkpoint. Human notes are written into notes.md BEFORE anything is revealed;
// `--reveal` then writes key.html, which joins the ids back to their arm, checkpoint,
// validator verdict and cost. A green machine result must not get the chance to frame a
// broken graphic as a success.
//
// ROUTES ARE POLICED by scripts/harness-route-policy.mjs, like every other paid runner here.
//
// Requires the dev server on this checkout's port. From a worktree, compose the environment
// first: `node scripts/bench-env.mjs --profile=pro`, then start the bench dev server.

/**
 * FORCE THE ONE RASTER THE STILL IS OF, on a graphic that has already settled.
 *
 * Every capture here mounts the graphic, calls `play()`, waits for the entrance to finish and
 * shoots. That was not byte-stable: recomposing the 2026-08-16 round moved 3 of its 36 frames
 * run to run with no code change in between, and 5 consecutive runs of one cell produced 5
 * different files. The bisect (docs/NOACG_PRO_PLAN.md §20) put it entirely after the
 * platform: the language, the composed html/css/js, the srcdoc and every element's rendered
 * geometry and paint style were byte-identical across the runs that disagreed. Only the pixels
 * moved, and only at glyph and panel EDGES.
 *
 * The cause is the composited layer the graphic animates on. `.lower-third-box` carries
 * `will-change: transform, opacity`, so it is promoted for the whole life of the page; the
 * entrance moves it; Chromium rasterises its texture DURING that move and - because the hint
 * says more transforms are coming - never re-rasterises once the tween settles. The frame we
 * keep is therefore a texture rasterised mid-flight, and which sub-pixel phase of the ~0.5 s
 * entrance that raster caught is machine timing.
 *
 * Dropping the hint for one frame invalidates the layer, so the settled content is rastered
 * once, at the offset it actually rests at; restoring it puts the graphic back exactly as the
 * template wrote it before the shutter. Both halves matter - a still taken with the hint
 * REMOVED is painted straight into the page instead, which switches text to sub-pixel
 * antialiasing and moves a glyph edge by up to 233/255 (that is a different picture, not a
 * stabler one).
 *
 * Measured: with this in place all 10 Anton frames are byte-identical across 5 runs, and the 7
 * that were already stable are byte-identical to their COMMITTED frames - the fix costs nothing
 * on evidence that never moved. Fast-forwarding the entrance instead (`timeScale`) lands on the
 * same bytes, which is the second, independent reason to believe the mechanism; it is not what
 * ships here because it would also fast-forward a timer graphic's own clock.

// ── The MOTION strips: entrance, update and exit, through the VIRTUAL CLOCK ─────────────
//
// This is the one piece of the wrapper that is new build rather than reuse, and the plan says
// why (§0.1, §0.2): a spike that inspects only settled holds has not reviewed motion, headless
// GSAP does not visibly tick on requestAnimationFrame, and deterministic timeline scrubbing
// exists today only in the RENDER compose path.
//
// It is new WIRING, not a new clock. The clock is src/render/runtimeScript.ts exactly as the
// renderer drives it: composeRenderDocument injects the virtual runtime before GSAP and the
// detach snippet after it, the graphic then executes its REAL lifecycle (update -> play ->
// stop) against time we own, and seek(t) fires due timers at their deadlines and drives
// gsap.updateRoot(t). A second scrubber built for the bench is how the bench and the renderer
// come to disagree about what a template does.
//
// IT LIVES IN THE DRIVER, NOT IN src/. `src/ai` may not import `src/render`
// (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §3, enforced by .dependency-cruiser.cjs), and a bench rig is a bad
// reason to widen a layering rule permanently - this script is outside the module graph and is
// the composition root that is allowed to reach any domain, which is the same way
// the retired pro-bench.mjs reached pro/, lite/pipeline and preview/ in one evaluate.
//
// FOUR THINGS IT HAS TO GET RIGHT, all load-bearing:
//   1. SEEKS ARE MONOTONIC - the runtime throws on a backward seek, so sample times are
//      produced already sorted and the host never rewinds inside one capture.
//   2. PAINT SETTLES ON THE HOST'S CLOCK. requestAnimationFrame inside the render document is
//      virtualized, so awaiting it there would never resolve; the host page's real double-rAF
//      is what proves a frame is painted (render-worker/remotion/NoaCGGraphic.tsx).
//   3. COLOR SCHEME MUST MATCH THE HOST PAGE. Chromium paints a scheme-mismatched iframe
//      opaque; the app declares dark, so the document is composed dark here where the renderer
//      composes it light for its own light host.
//   4. A CONTINUOUS PHASE reports a duration of 0 (runtimeScript's CONTINUOUS_S rule), so its
//      strip is sampled over a fixed window - a looping entrance is motion, and collapsing it
//      to one frame would hide the thing the strip exists to show.
//
// ── AND THE STRIPS ARE ALSO PLAYED, NOT ONLY LAID OUT ──────────────────────────────────
//
// The owner's rule from the brand round: STILLS CANNOT JUDGE MOTION. Five frames across an
// entrance say where the graphic passed through, never how it felt getting there - easing,
// overshoot, stagger and settle all live between the samples, and "does the motion support the
// composition" is one of the questions §0.2 asks a human to answer.
//
// So each strip is ALSO sampled at a real frame rate and encoded to a webm the gallery plays in
// place. Three properties make that safe to bolt onto an instrument that is already calibrated:
//
//   * THE FIVE STILL TIMES ARE UNCHANGED. The clip grid is merged INTO the same monotonic
//     sample list rather than replacing it, so `frames` still carries exactly the five stills
//     per strip that markMotionSummary, the blinding and the key already read. A denser mark
//     sampling would be a better instrument and a DIFFERENT one, and the mark gate was
//     calibrated 7/7 against this one.
//   * THE CLIP IS THE SAME CLOCK. Nothing new is scrubbed: the extra samples are more seeks on
//     the cursor the stills already advance, so a clip can never show motion the strip denies.
//   * A MISSING ffmpeg DEGRADES TO WHAT WE HAD. The encoder is optional; without it the round
//     still captures, still writes its ledger, and the gallery falls back to stills alone. A
//     paid round must never die on a presentation dependency.
