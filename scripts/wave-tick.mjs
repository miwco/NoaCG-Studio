// THE WATCH LOOP'S ONE COMMAND - the whole observation leg of an orchestrator tick, and only
// observation (docs/ORCHESTRATION_NEXT.md §3; .agent-workflows/orchestrator/night.md "The watch loop").
//
//   node scripts/wave-tick.mjs             # fetch, look at everything, print what CHANGED
//   node scripts/wave-tick.mjs --no-fetch  # same, without touching the network
//
// Before this existed a tick was several commands the orchestrator ran and parsed itself - fetch,
// per-branch ancestor checks, `npm run jobs`, `blocked-sessions` - most of whose output restated
// what the previous tick already said. This script keeps the previous tick's snapshot in
// `<git-common-dir>/noacg-jobs/wave-tick-state.json` (beside the job store, same lifetime rules)
// and prints only the DELTA: what landed, what was queued, what gave up and why, who started or
// stopped waiting, and any branch that looks finished but was never queued. A tick where nothing
// changed prints one line. The judgement about what to DO with an event never lives here - this
// script launches nothing, kills nothing, merges nothing, and messages nobody.
//
// EVENTS ARE DURABLE, NOT JUST PRINTED. Every event line is also appended to
// `<git-common-dir>/noacg-jobs/wave-tick-events.log` with its timestamp, because stdout goes to a
// session whose context can be compacted or interrupted - and the state file has already recorded
// the event as "seen", so no later tick will repeat it. Without the log, an event caught between
// the script exiting and the model reading would be announced exactly zero times; the morning
// report reads the log instead of hoping the loop's context survived the night.
//
// THE FINISHED-BUT-UNQUEUED CHECK is the mechanism for the most repeated 2026-08-30 failure:
// three sessions finished their work, armed a background watcher, and ENDED - each leaving a
// green branch committed and never queued. An in-session Stop hook was considered and rejected
// (it fires at every turn end, so it would warn on every mid-work pause, and a crashed session
// never fires it at all); from out here the state is unambiguous to observe and cheap to
// re-check. "Finished-looking" is deliberately modest: ahead of main, clean tree, no commit for
// QUIET_MINUTES, not queued, not landed. Whether it is actually done is the orchestrator's
// judgement - this only makes the shape visible while somebody can still act on it.
