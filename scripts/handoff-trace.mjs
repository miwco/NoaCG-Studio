// IS THIS HANDOFF SAFE TO DESTROY? - the pure half of the notice in scripts/hooks/warn-command.mjs
// and scripts/hooks/warn-edit.mjs.
//
// WHAT IT GUARDS. A handoff is the only place some facts live. On 2026-09-01 a planner classified
// thirteen handoff files as `spent` by reading their headings; four were not spent, and
// `docs/handoffs/2026-08-30-n-ograf-checker.md` held the only analysis of an unfixed OGraf defect
// (a graphic's stylesheet restyling its host page). It was deleted and then restored by hand,
// which is the only reason the analysis exists today - `docs/backlog/ograf-checker-83-rules.md`
// X-04 cites it. `scripts/handoff-drain.mjs` made the classification VISIBLE afterwards; this
// makes the destruction itself say something at the moment it happens.
//
// WHY IT IS A NOTICE AND NOT A REFUSAL. "Has this item been traced" is a judgement, and the wave
// plan that records the trace is a GITIGNORED file in the orchestrator's own worktree - so a
// session deleting handoffs from its own checkout may hold no copy of the record at all. A
// refusal keyed on a file this checkout might not have would block the ordinary case: the wave row
// whose whole job is to drain the folder. Deleting a handoff is also recoverable, which its
// siblings' failures are not: the file is tracked, so `git restore` brings it back, and saying so
// at the moment of the deletion is worth more than stopping it.
//
// THE RULE, in one line: say something when what is being destroyed still lists OPEN ITEMS and no
// wave plan records where they went.
