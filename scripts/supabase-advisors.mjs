// The SUPABASE ADVISOR gate: fails on a NEW advisor finding, ignores the accepted ones.
//
// Why a baseline rather than a plain "run the advisors" check: most of what the advisors report
// here is this project working as designed and will never clear. Two dozen findings are
// `SECURITY DEFINER` functions callable by `anon` - which is the whole capability-URL model
// (docs/CLOUD_PLAYOUT.md, docs/CONTROL_LAYER.md): a CasparCG or OBS client holding an output
// slug is unauthenticated by construction, and switching those to `SECURITY INVOKER` would
// break browser output entirely. Another twenty-one are tables with RLS enabled and no policies,
// which is DENY-ALL - the stricter posture, not a gap; the linter simply cannot tell
// "locked down deliberately" from "forgot to write policies".
//
// So the warning count does not go to zero, and chasing it there would mean dismantling the
// capability model or weakening deny-all. What DOES clear is an accident: 0041 and 0042 each
// removed a definer function that carried Supabase's default EXECUTE grant nobody chose.
// scripts/definer-grants.test.mjs is the offline guard that stops a third one shipping.
//
// A permanent wall of fifty-plus warnings trains you to ignore the report, and then a genuinely
// new one - a table someone added without policies, a function accidentally exposed - arrives
// into a list nobody reads. So this records what has been SEEN AND ACCEPTED and alarms only on
// what is new. Same shape as scripts/overflow-sweep.mjs, for the same reason: ~200 catalog
// variants clip by design, so that gate diffs against a baseline too.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/supabase-advisors.mjs                     # fail on anything not in the baseline
//   node scripts/supabase-advisors.mjs --update-baseline   # accept the current findings
//   node scripts/supabase-advisors.mjs --input <file.json> # read a saved payload instead of the API
//   node scripts/supabase-advisors.mjs --json              # machine-readable report
//
// Needs a Management API personal access token in SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN - taken from the real
// environment or from the checkout's `.env`, the same way check-model-ids.mjs finds its provider
// keys (the CLI's own login is stored elsewhere and is deliberately not read here). That is why
// this is NOT part of .github/workflows/weekly-audit.yml, which is secret-free on purpose - see
// docs/STACK_FRESHNESS.md.
