// Refuse tracked files that nobody meant to commit: an unexpected entry at the repo ROOT, or a
// path segment that is really a mistyped command-line flag.
//
// Why this exists. On 2026-08-09 a sweep was invoked as `node scripts/l3-sweep.mjs --category
// lower-third`. That script takes POSITIONAL arguments, so `--category` became its output
// directory: it created one with that literal name, wrote 90 screenshots into it, and a
// `git add -A` in an unrelated commit carried all of them onto `main`. Nothing referenced them,
// every gate stayed green, and it was found two merges later by reading a diff during handoff.
//
// The specific cause is fixed where it happened (`scripts/out-dir.mjs`, used by every script
// that takes an out-dir). This is the layer under that: it does not care WHICH tool produced a
// stray file or which flag was mistyped, only that something is tracked which should not be. The
// two shapes below are the ones that cost real time, and both are cheap to state exactly.
//
// It is a hard gate rather than a report because the failure is invisible by nature - junk at the
// root breaks nothing, so nothing else will ever complain about it, and it propagates into every
// worktree created afterwards.
