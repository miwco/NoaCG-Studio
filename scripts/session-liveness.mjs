// Is anybody SITTING in this worktree right now?
//
// Containment answers "can this deletion lose committed work?" - it cannot, by construction.
// It does not answer the other question an unattended sweep has to get right: whether a session
// is still open in that folder. A session that landed its branch through the merge queue and is
// still mid-conversation has a clean tree and a fully contained branch, so every containment
// rule says "eligible" while pulling the floor out from under it.
//
// THE SIGNAL. Claude Code appends every turn to a JSONL transcript as it happens, under
// ~/.claude/projects/<sanitised-cwd>/, where the directory name is the session's working
// directory with every character outside [A-Za-z0-9-] replaced by a dash (so
// C:\claude\NoaCG-Studio\.claude\worktrees\x becomes
// C--claude-NoaCG-Studio--claude-worktrees-x). The newest mtime under that directory is the
// last moment a session did anything in that worktree. scripts/blocked-sessions.mjs reads the
// same tree for a different question.
//
// TWO LOOKUPS, BECAUSE ONE MISSES THE COMMONEST CASE. A worktree-isolated SUBAGENT does not get
// a directory of its own: its transcript is filed under the PARENT session's directory as
// <session>/subagents/<agent>.jsonl, and the parent's cwd is the primary checkout. Measured on
// this machine: nineteen `agent-*` worktrees existed and exactly three had a directory named
// after them, so the by-name lookup alone reported almost every live agent worktree as idle. So
// this also sweeps the transcripts CHANGED INSIDE THE IDLE WINDOW - a handful of files, since
// mtime filters before anything is opened - and reads each one's tail for the `cwd` its turns
// record. Only that field is taken from the file.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT SEE, stated plainly because the sweep relies on it. A session that is not
// Claude Code writes nothing here: a Codex session, or a plain shell, in a worktree whose branch
// has landed leaves no signal at all, and this reports it as nobody's. Nor is every agent
// worktree locked - measured on this machine, 3 of 23 were, all of them agents running right
// then - so the lock is a real signal but covers only live subagents.
//
// That fail-open is deliberate and is confined to POLITENESS. Nothing here is what makes a
// deletion safe: containment against a fresh origin/main is, and it fails closed, as do the
// uncommitted-changes check, the in-progress-operation check and archive verification. The worst
// this guard can do by missing a session is delete a folder whose work is already on main -
// annoying, never lossy.
