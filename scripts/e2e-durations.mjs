// HOW LONG EACH SPEC FILE TAKES - the measured table `scripts/e2e-affected.mjs` sizes a CI run's
// shard count from, and the command that refreshes it.
//
//   node scripts/e2e-durations.mjs --check                 # report drift, change nothing
//   npm run record:e2e-durations                           # re-record from the newest green full run

//   node scripts/e2e-durations.mjs <merged-report.json>    # rewrite the table from a report you merged
//
// WHY A TABLE AND NOT A FILE COUNT. Until 2026-08-19 CI sized its shards off the NUMBER of spec
// files in the plan: nine shards for a full run, and `min(4, floor(files / 4))` for a subset.
// File count is a bad proxy for time - the spread across these 128 files is 0.001 min to 3.33 -
// and the cap made it worse the bigger the plan got. Measured on the 60 CI runs to 2026-08-19:
//
//   run 32174589727   103 specs  58.3 min of tests  on 4 shards = 14.6 min per shard
//   run 32152498866    88 specs  51.8 min           on 4 shards = 12.9 min per shard
//   run 32215290709    73 specs  40.8 min           on 4 shards = 10.2 min per shard
//   (a FULL run)      128 specs  66.9 min           on 9 shards =  7.4 min per shard
//
// A subset covering 80% of the suite was running on 44% of the runners, so a "cheap" targeted
// run finished LATER than the full suite it was meant to be cheaper than. Sizing off measured
// minutes puts every one of those at ~7 min per shard instead.
//
// WHAT IT DECIDES, AND WHAT IT CANNOT BREAK. Until 2026-09-04 this table only decided HOW MANY
// runners the plan asked for, and Playwright's own `--shard=i/n` did the assigning - so a stale
// entry cost wall clock and nothing else. It now also decides shard BALANCE: `packShards`
// (scripts/e2e-affected.mjs) bin-packs spec files by these durations and CI hands each runner an
// explicit file list. A wrong weight therefore costs a lopsided shard, which is how four `main`
// runs died at the 20-minute cap on 2026-09-03/04.
//
// AND SINCE 2026-09-04 IT ALSO CARRIES WHAT A SHARD COSTS BESIDES ITS TESTS (`overhead` below).
// The per-spec numbers were never the problem - measured against run 33854844447 they predicted
// the test STEP to 2.7% - but the planner read them as the shard's WALL CLOCK, and a runner also
// checks out, installs, starts Playwright and boots a dev server. That term averaged 6.4 minutes
// on the ten runs to that morning and reached 10.2 at the p90, which is what killed two shards
// carrying only 9.8 measured minutes each. Recording it is what lets `budgetMinutes` say how much
// a shard can carry and `emitJson` say when a plan does not fit, before the run rather than after.
//
// It still cannot cost COVERAGE, which is what kept bin-packing off the table for three weeks:
// the packer takes the suite from the e2e DIRECTORY (`specFilesOnDisk`) and reads this file for
// weights only, so an unmeasured spec is packed at the median and never dropped; the assignment
// asserts that its bins are exactly the suite; and the plan job warns, naming every spec it had
// to guess at. That is why this file is still not a gate and lives under `scripts/` (ignored by
// the affected-spec map: nothing a spec can observe changes when it does).
//
// HOW TO REFRESH IT. `npm run record:e2e-durations` does the whole thing. The numbers come from a
// real CI run's shard reports, because that is the hardware they are used on - a laptop's timings
// are a different machine's - so the command picks the newest GREEN FULL run of ci.yml on `main`
// (main always runs full), downloads its blob reports, merges them and rewrites the table,
// stamping which run it came from. Name a run id to use that one instead.
//
// A HALF-RUN IS REFUSED, not silently recorded: a run whose E2E jobs are not all `(full)`, or that
// is missing a shard, measures a SUBSET, and writing that would drop every unmeasured spec back to
// the median. Blob artifacts are kept for 7 days, so re-record from a recent run.

 * Every consumer reads `overhead` through `readTable`, so this is the shape they all see, and the
 * value they get until a run is recorded. It is not a bare guess: on the cache-hit path a shard's
 * setup is checkout (0.05 min), setup-node (0.05), the node_modules restore, the browser cache
 * (0.05, measured at 2.9 s for 261 MB on run 33854844447) and the artifact upload (0.02), and the
 * 1.05 factor is the ratio the same run showed between the shard STEPS and this table's totals.
 *
 * IT IS DELIBERATELY THE OPTIMISTIC END, and the table SHIPS without a recorded overhead on
 * purpose. The only overhead measurements in reach on 2026-09-04 came from runs that paid an
 * uncached `npm ci` - 6.6 min at the p90 - and `.github/actions/node-modules` removes exactly
 * that cost in the same commit. Carrying that number forward would have made a brand-new
 * instrument raise a permanent alarm about a configuration that no longer exists, which is how a
 * warning gets trained out of people. So the first honest reading has to come from a green FULL
 * run on `main` WITH the cache: `npm run record:e2e-durations`. Until then `--check` says the
 * figures are defaults, in those words.

/**
 * THE PART OF A SHARD'S WALL CLOCK THAT IS NOT IN THE PER-SPEC TABLE.
 *
 * WHY IT HAS TO BE RECORDED. Until 2026-09-04 the table described the sum of Playwright's own
 * `result.duration` values and the planner treated that as the shard's wall clock. The sum is
 * excellent at what it measures - across the nine shards of run 33854844447 it predicted the
 * test STEP to 2.7% in aggregate - and it says nothing at all about the twenty minutes the job
 * actually has. Two shards of that run were killed at the cap carrying 9.8 measured minutes
 * each, because the job spent ten minutes in `npm ci` first and no number anywhere knew.
 *
 * So the model is now `wall clock = tests x testFactor + jobMinutes`, and both terms come from
 * the same run the per-spec minutes come from:
 *
 * - `jobMinutes` is the job's wall clock minus its `E2E shard` step: checkout, setup-node, the
 *   install, the browser cache, the artifact upload. Recorded at the p90 rather than the mean,
 *   because a cap kills the WORST shard and the mean is not what has to fit. `medianJobMinutes`
 *   rides along so the two can be compared - a wide gap is the signature of an install that is
 *   sometimes fast and sometimes not, which is exactly the fault this term was added to expose.
 * - `testFactor` is the shard STEPS' total over the table's total: Playwright's own start, the
 *   dev-server boot, and whatever a test costs the runner outside `result.duration`. It is
 *   floored at 1 because CI runs `workers: 1` (playwright.config.ts), so a step can never be
 *   shorter than the tests it ran; a value below 1 means the run was not the serial one this
 *   assumes and the figure would be misleading rather than merely wrong.
 *
 * Pure, so it can be tested against a recorded jobs payload with no network.
 *
 * @param {Array<{ name?: string, started_at?: string, completed_at?: string,
 *                 steps?: Array<{ name?: string, started_at?: string, completed_at?: string }> }>} jobs
 *        the REST shape of `/actions/runs/{id}/jobs` (snake_case - `gh run view` does not carry steps)
 * @param {number} totalTestMinutes the table's own total for the same run
