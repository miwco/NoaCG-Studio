// THE CATALOG SPECS, SCOPED - one door, one flag, one place the ids are checked.
//
//   node scripts/catalog-specs.mjs                    # the whole catalog (same as npm run test:e2e:catalog)
//   node scripts/catalog-specs.mjs --only lt01,lt02   # just these designs
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN AN ENV PREFIX. Playwright gives a spec no argv channel, so the
// scope has to reach the specs as an environment variable (`e2e/_catalogScope.ts`). Printing
// `NOACG_ONLY_DESIGNS=lt01 npm run test:e2e:catalog` as the command to run made that variable a
// second user-facing interface - and a broken one on this repo's own platform: the job runner
// spawns with `shell: true`, which is cmd.exe on win32, where a leading `VAR=value` is not a
// variable assignment but a command nobody has. So `--only` is the ONE spelling across all six
// gates, and the env var goes back to being transport.
//
// AND IT IS WHERE A BAD SCOPE IS CAUGHT. Every catalog spec disables its own vacuity floor while
// a scope is set - correctly, because under an explicit scope a slice with no multi-column design
// in it is the ordinary case rather than a detection that stopped matching. Put that together with
// a scope naming ids the catalog does not ship and the whole battery measures NOTHING and reports
// green: a stale command line, a design renamed since the plan was printed, a typo. The ids are
// therefore resolved against the real catalog HERE, in about a second and with no dev server, and
// an unknown one refuses before Playwright starts.
//
// It runs both configs, because "the catalog specs" is both: the calibration tripwire and its
// siblings under e2e/catalog/, and e2e/catalog-baseline.spec.ts, which lives in the default suite
// (playwright.config.ts ignores `**/catalog/**`) and is the only place the RENDER baseline is
// compared. Running one and calling it the catalog specs is how that baseline came to be the one
// thing that only ever failed in CI.
