// together when the slot frees; and nothing anywhere shows a QUEUE, so "correctly queued" and

// starts, which removes all three.
//
// The arithmetic - capacity, dependencies, reaping - lives in jobs-store.mjs and is unit-tested.
// This file is the part that talks to the OS: spawning, killing a process TREE, and electing
