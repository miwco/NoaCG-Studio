// WHAT THE NEXT DESIGN COSTS - the owner's question of 2026-09-04, answered as a number rather
// than a paragraph:
//
//   "one thing I want to make sure of before we implement more graphics is that it won't make
//    our site heavier. It won't make our CI and E2E tests take even longer, because right now
//    iteration speed is still more important than a broad template gallery."
//
//   npm run check:catalog-cost
//
// It REPORTS and never gates, like `check:freshness` (root AGENTS.md, verifying-changes rule 6):
// the point is a number somebody can read before agreeing to another weekly package of designs,
// and a red build would only teach people to stop reading it.
//
// THE THREE PLACES A DESIGN COSTS ANYTHING, and they are not the same kind of cost:
//
//   1. THE PRERENDER, paid by EVERY build including the one gating a one-line fix. One HTML page
//      per design, forever. Measured here, live, by running the real loader and the real page
//      loop out of scripts/prerender.mjs - not a copy of them, so this number cannot drift away
//      from what a build actually pays.
//   2. THE CLIENT BUNDLE, paid by every VISITOR. `src/templates/catalog.ts` carries static
//      imports, so the question is which chunk the designs land in and whether app.html pulls it
//      on first paint. Read off `dist/` when a build is there.
//   3. THE RENDERED CATALOG GATES, paid ONLY by a change that can move a design, and then only
//      for the designs it can move (scripts/catalog-affected.mjs). This is the O(designs) half,
//      and its slope comes from two real CI runs of the same workflow on the same runner class -
//      see RENDERED below.
//
// THE MECHANISM THAT KEEPS IT FLAT is `catalog-affected.mjs`, not a promise: an ordinary catalog
// change measures its own designs and pays the fixed overhead once, so the 332nd design adds
// nothing to it. The slope below only applies to a FULL sweep, which happens when a SHARED file
// changes - and that is the one case where measuring everything is the whole point.

/**
 * THE CI SLOPE, MEASURED, not modelled.
 *
 * Two runs of `.github/workflows/catalog-gates.yml` on 2026-09-04, same workflow, same steps,
 * same runner class, differing only in how many designs they were scoped to - which is exactly
 * the A/B this number needs and the only pair of its kind that exists:
 *
 *   run 33896869659  the WHOLE catalog (it escalated by accident, which is what makes it useful)
 *                    - sweeps 657 s; emit 6 s + catalog specs 243 s
 *   run 33898338599  ONE design - sweeps 32 s; emit 2 s + catalog specs 39 s
 *   run 33900304138  ONE design, repeated - sweeps 31 s; emit 3 s + catalog specs 41 s
 *
 * The catalog held 502 designs through all three: the only src/templates commits that day were
 * comment edits to lt01, the scaffolding those runs used, since reverted. An individual sweep
 * prints a smaller denominator - `numerals` says "1 of 331 designs" - because each sweep has its
 * own idea of which designs it can measure at all. The line below is per CATALOG design, which
 * is the unit the question is asked in.
 *
 * Slope and intercept are the straight line through the full-catalog point and the mean of the
 * two one-design points. The two jobs run in PARALLEL, so wall clock follows the slower of them
 * while runner minutes are their sum; both are reported because they answer different questions.
 *
 * TO RE-MEASURE: `gh workflow run catalog-gates.yml --ref main -f designs=lt01`, then again with
 * `-f designs=all`, and read the step durations out of
 * `gh api repos/:owner/:repo/actions/runs/<id>/jobs`. Two runs, about fifteen minutes, no laptop.

/**
 * Which built chunks carry the designs, and whether the entry HTML pulls them on first paint.
 *
 * Attribution is by counting the design ids that survive minification as string literals. It is
 * a lower bound rather than an exact byte split - a chunk holds shared code too - which is
 * enough for the question actually being asked: are the designs in the chunk every visitor
 * downloads, or in one that loads when somebody opens the catalog.
 *
 * ALL THREE QUOTE CHARACTERS, and the backtick is the one that matters: the minifier rewrites
 * `id: 'lt01'` to id:`lt01`, so a check looking only for the quotes the SOURCE uses finds
 * nothing and reports the catalog as absent from a bundle it is plainly in.
 *
 * "FIRST PAYLOAD" MEANS STATICALLY REACHABLE from a page's own script tag, walked transitively. A
 * chunk the entry reaches only through `await import(...)` is not part of the first payload
 * however certain it is to be fetched a moment later, and calling those the same thing would
 * answer the wrong question: the studio's App chunk IS dynamically imported, right after boot, on
 * every visit to /app.
 *
 * EVERY PAGE, enumerated from `dist/` rather than named. This is a ten-page MPA and the first
 * version of this check looked at `index.html` and `app.html` only - which reported the catalog
 * as absent from every first payload while `/ograf` was statically pulling 3.7 MB of it from its
 * own entry chunk. A hardcoded page list answers for the pages somebody remembered.
