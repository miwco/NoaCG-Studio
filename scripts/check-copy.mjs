// THE COPY A USER READS MUST NOT READ AS MACHINE-WRITTEN.
//
// The owner's complaint, 2026-08-26, is specific and it is the most common one this product gets:
// the em-dash is "the one thing people complain about, claiming it's AI-written". A reader who
// decides a broadcast tool was written by a machine stops trusting the graphics it makes, and no
// amount of correctness argues them back out of it. So the tells are a BUILD GATE, not a style
// note somebody remembers.
//
// WHAT IS IN SCOPE: text a user can read.
//   - Product UI:      src/components, src/landing, src/docs, index.html, docs.html
//   - Emitted code:    src/templates - the HTML/CSS/JS a template WRITES, comments included,
//                      because those comments ship inside every export a customer opens.
//   - Published READMEs: README.md is the repository's front page and cli/README.md and
//                      cli/plugin/README.md are shipped to npm. All three are read by strangers,
//                      so they are copy in exactly the sense this gate means.
//
// WHAT IS OUT OF SCOPE, deliberately:
//   - Source code comments. A comment in a .tsx file is a note between maintainers; it is not
//     copy, nobody outside this repo reads it, and sweeping it in would triple the surface for no
//     reader. The one exception is a comment INSIDE an emitted template literal, which is exactly
//     the code the export ships.
//   - Maintainer docs (docs/, AGENTS.md, this file). Same reason.
//
// HOW IT HOLDS THE LINE: a per-file, per-rule COUNT BASELINE (scripts/copy-baseline.json).
// The catalog and the app carry ~5,300 of these lines today, which is a drain job and not a
// tonight job - a gate that red-mains five hundred files on the day it lands gets switched off in
// a week. So the baseline freezes what exists and the gate refuses everything NEW.
//
// The baseline is EXACT in both directions. A count that drops is just as much a stale baseline as
// one that climbs: leave the high number in place and the file silently regains room for a tell it
// had already given up. Re-record with:
//
//   npm run check:copy -- --update
//
// The drain is a real piece of work with an owner ruling behind it, filed as
// docs/backlog/copy-tells-drain.md. Every entry that reaches zero disappears from the baseline on
// the next --update, so the file itself is the progress bar.
//
// Run: node scripts/check-copy.mjs   (part of `npm run build`)
