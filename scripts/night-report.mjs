// THE NIGHT REPORT - what the queue did while nobody was awake, in one command.
//
// THE FAILURE IT ANSWERS. The queue lands branches unattended, and by morning the only trace is
// GitHub failure mail and 560-odd job records in a directory nobody opens. On 2026-09-04 the
// owner woke to the mail and no summary, and the four facts he actually needed - what landed,
// what refused and WHY, what the queue repaired by itself, and what is still sitting there
// waiting for a person - were each available and none of them were together.
//
// Naming refusals (2026-09-04) put the WHY on the record: every merge job that refuses now carries
// `refusal.kind`, and `refusalGuidance` in jobs-store.mjs owns what each kind means, the one
// command that answers it, and whether the QUEUE or the SESSION runs that command. This script
// does no classifying of its own - it reads those kinds back and groups by them. A kind this
// script invented would be a second vocabulary that drifts from the one the queue acts on.
//
// IT IS A REPORT, NEVER A GATE (docs/ROUTINES.md). It writes no job, cancels nothing, queues
// nothing, and exits 0 whatever it finds - including when the news is bad. A morning report that
// can fail is a morning report that sometimes does not arrive.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/night-report.mjs                 # the last 12 hours, to stdout
//   node scripts/night-report.mjs --hours 24      # a longer window
//   node scripts/night-report.mjs --since 2026-09-04T18:00
//   node scripts/night-report.mjs --json          # the same facts, structured
//   node scripts/night-report.mjs --write         # also docs/handoffs/night-report.local.md
