// A function serialized into a preview document with `.toString()` must be bound under the name
// the BUNDLER gave it, not under the name this repo's source spells.
//
// The failure this gate exists for is invisible in every environment a developer or the e2e suite
// can reach. `.toString()` returns a function's source AS THE BUNDLER LEFT IT. `npm run dev`
// serves the original identifiers, so a serialized `runSimCommand` calling `killAllTimelines(w)`
// finds the helper composeDocument.ts bound under that spelling. `vite build` MINIFIES both, so
// the same emitted body reads `Q(w)` while the document still binds `killAllTimelines` — and
// composeDocument wraps every command in `try { … } catch (e) {}`, so the `ReferenceError` is
// swallowed. On https://noacg.studio that silently killed the editor's whole simulator: the stage
// never settled (blank canvas) and Play, Stop, Next, scrub and snap all did nothing. Both e2e
// configs run `npm run dev`, so no spec could ever have seen it. Measured and fixed 2026-09-02;
// this gate is what keeps it fixed.
//
// The rule is the ONE DOOR: composeDocument.ts's `serializeHelper` is the only place allowed to
// interpolate a MODULE-SCOPE binding's source into a document, because it is the only place that
// emits the `fn.name` binding the bundle's own call sites need. Anything else writing
// `${killAllTimelines.toString()}` into a template literal is the old bug being retyped.
//
// Scans SOURCE, not `dist/`: the mistake is made in a source file, the artifact only hides it.

 * Only a module-scope binding is a hazard, because only a module-scope binding gets renamed. That
 * single test does all the discrimination this gate needs, and it is why there is no
 * comment-stripping or string-parsing here at all:
 *
 * - `${fn.toString()}` inside `serializeHelper` — `fn` is a parameter. Not module scope, ignored,
 *   so the door needs no exemption of its own.
 * - `${fn.toString()}` in prose explaining this rule — same, ignored. Blanking comments to catch
 *   that was the earlier design, and it could blank real code inside a template literal (a `//`
 *   in a URL, a `/*` in emitted CSS) and MISS a violation. A gate no test can back up must not
 *   have a silent false negative; a rare false positive it can be argued with is the safe side.
 * - `${new URL(base).toString()}`, `${count.toString()}` on a local — not a bare module-scope
 *   name, ignored. Those are ordinary correct code and this gate has no business failing them.
 *
 * A module-scope number or URL named in an interpolation is the one false positive left, and
 * `IGNORE_MARKER` on the line is how it steps aside.
