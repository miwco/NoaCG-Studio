// IS MAIN ITSELF GREEN RIGHT NOW? The question the landing gate never asked.
//
//   node scripts/main-health.mjs [--json]
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. `auto-merge.mjs` gates hard on the INTEGRATED sha - is this branch, merged with
// main, green? - and that is the right question about the branch. It is not a question about main.
// So when main went red on 2026-08-27, every queued landing integrated a red main, gated green on
// its own merge commit (the failing spec was not in that branch's affected plan), pushed, and
// started another main run that failed the same way. `ci.yml` sets `cancel-in-progress: false` for
// main deliberately, so nothing collapsed those, and GitHub mailed a CheckSuite failure for each.
//
// ONE defect, 35 hours, 27 emails (docs/CI_STABILITY.md, measured 2026-08-15..29). The mechanism
// that turns those 27 back into 1 is this file: a red main stops the queue until a person fixes
// main. Refusing is not the cost - the landings were never going to be safe to promote onto a red
// main anyway; all the queue was doing was re-reporting somebody else's bug under new sha names.
//
// WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO:
//   - It never treats "no answer" as red. No completed run (a fresh repo, a fresh main), an
//     unreachable `gh`, a run still in flight - all proceed, with a printed note. This gate makes
//     the inbox quieter; it must never make the queue mysteriously stop.
//   - It never treats a CANCELLED run as a verdict, the standing rule in docs/VERIFICATION.md.
//   - It is not the safety gate. The branch's own green gate on the integrated sha still decides
//     whether the branch may land, exactly as before, and nothing here relaxes it.
//
// THE THIRD ANSWER, added 2026-09-04. Skipping cancelled runs is right and stays. What was wrong
// is that skipping had no floor: this file walked back through as many cancelled runs as it took
// to find a verdict and then quoted it as the present tense. On 2026-09-04 it answered "main is
// green" citing run 30964711888 - from 2026-08-05, four weeks and a different commit earlier -
// because concurrency cancellation and shard-cap kills had become common enough to fill the whole
// 30-run window. Nobody could tell that answer apart from a genuine green.
//
// So `green` now means "a recent verdict says success", and a verdict too old or buried under too
// many unjudged runs reports `stale` instead. Stale PROCEEDS, like `unknown` - the rule above that
// this gate must never mysteriously stop the queue is untouched - but it says what it does not
// know rather than dressing an old fact up as a current one. Both numbers ride along in every
// message, green ones included, so the fact is visible before it crosses a threshold.

 * red seconds ago when it has been red since yesterday morning.
 *
 * `skipped` counts the runs NEWER than the verdict that carried none of their own, and `verdictAt`
 * is when the verdict was created. Together they are what separates a green from a `stale` - and
 * they are reported on a green too, because the interesting moment is before a threshold trips.
