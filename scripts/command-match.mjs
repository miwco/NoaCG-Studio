// DOES THIS SHELL COMMAND START HEAVY BROWSER WORK? - the one place that decides.
//
// WHY IT IS ITS OWN MODULE. Two consumers need the same answer from opposite directions:
// `scripts/hooks/guard-command.mjs` asks it of a command ABOUT to run, and `scripts/e2e-runs.mjs`
// asks the equivalent of a process ALREADY running. Keeping the list of sweeps in both meant two
// copies of the same fact, and a sweep added to one and not the other is a silent hole - the
// guard would refuse to start it while the detector reported the machine idle, or the reverse.
//
// It also has to be importable, and the hook is not: `guard-command.mjs` reads stdin at module
// top level, so importing it to test its matchers would hang waiting for input that never comes.
// A pure module has no such problem, which is the second reason this file exists.
//
// The matchers are POSITIONAL. Matching a bare string anywhere in the command text was wrong in
// a way that bit within a day: `grep -n "npm run test:e2e" AGENTS.md` contains the phrase and
// starts nothing, and denying it teaches everyone to route around the guard. So the command is
// split on shell separators and each segment is tested at its FIRST token, where an invocation
// has to live. A quoted argument is never in that position.

 *
 * THE SPIKE FAMILY WAS ADDED 2026-08-15, AFTER FALLING INTO THE HOLE. `spike-mark-clearance-sweep`
 * renders 24 designs at 1920x1080 through the app for about four minutes - the same workload a
 * suite is, by the same measure - and it was started three times beside another worktree's live
 * configured suite, because nothing in the alternation matched its name. The `spike-*` set plus
 * `pro-spike` are one rig: the Pro spike runner and the calibration sweeps that read its
 * thresholds off the catalog. `[\w-]*spike[\w-]*` is deliberately the same shape as the `*bench*`
 * entry beside it, so a NEW spike script is covered by being named like its siblings rather than
 * by somebody remembering this file. The price of a name-shaped rule is that it also catches

 * else that wants to start a server goes through it or through the preview tools.
 *
 * Positional like every matcher here, so `grep -n "npm run dev" AGENTS.md` and a commit message
 * quoting the command are not invocations - but positional alone is too SHY for this particular
 * rule, because a dev server is routinely reached through something else. `nohup npm run dev`,
 * `start npm run dev`, `bash -c "npm run dev"` and `cd x & npm run dev` all start a real server
 * on a real port, and the plain regex this replaced caught every one of them by matching the
