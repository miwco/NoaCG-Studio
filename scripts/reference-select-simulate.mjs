// Dry-run the reference selection of a WHOLE paid bench pass, for free.
//
//   node scripts/reference-select-simulate.mjs [briefs.json] [runs]
//
// Requires the dev server (this checkout's port); imports the real selector through Vite.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The paid A/B (contrast selection vs the legacy keyword pick) costs real
// money per pass, and most of what separates the two arms is decided BEFORE any model call:
// which reference cards each generation is handed. That part is fully deterministic, so it can
// be replayed exactly, for nothing.
//
// The replay is faithful only if it copies the bench's real shape, which is easy to get wrong:
//   - `video-bench.mjs` iterates BRIEF-outer, RUN-inner, over ONE page. localStorage therefore
//     survives every generation in a pass, so the anti-dominance ledger WARMS as the pass runs.
//     Generation 21 does not see what generation 1 saw.
//   - `claudeVideoProvider.directMotion` calls `noteReferenceUse` exactly once per generation,
//     right after selecting - so one generation is one ledger write of the whole chosen set.
//   - Recency filters COMPANIONS only. The anchor is picked before the ledger is consulted, so
//     a brief's anchor repeats across its runs by construction; only the companion rotates.
//   - The legacy arm writes the ledger too (the provider always does) but never reads it, so
//     those writes are inert. Simulated anyway rather than special-cased.
//
// WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT DECIDE. It reports the reference sets, not the videos made from
// them, so it is a VETO and not a green light. If the two arms hand over near-identical sets,
// the paid pass cannot measure anything and should not be bought. If they differ sharply, the
// pass is worth running - but only real generations can say whether different references
// actually produce better or more distinct DESIGNS.
