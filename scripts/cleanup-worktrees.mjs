// Bulk cleanup of stale worktrees, their merged local and GitHub branches, stale worktree
// metadata, and empty leftover folders - safely, from the primary `main` checkout.
//
// Default is a read-only DRY RUN. Pass --apply to actually delete. The shared cleanup workflow
// drives this: dry-run, show the plan, then apply when the assessment is clean.
//
// The ONE trustworthy test for "this work is safely in main" is commit containment:
//   git rev-list --count <ref> --not main   == 0
// (equivalently `git merge-base --is-ancestor <ref> main`). Branch names, `gone` upstream
// markers, and human/AI memory are NEVER trusted for a deletion decision - a branch that
// merged main into itself, or an old ancestor tip, both look alarming by name/diff yet are
// fully contained. Automatic removal requires containment in BOTH local main and origin/main:
// local containment proves the primary checkout has the work, and remote containment proves it
// has been backed up outside this machine. Ahead, behind, and divergence are surfaced explicitly.
//
// Containment only sees true ancestry, so a branch merged via "squash and merge" (a new commit,
// not an ancestor of the original branch) never passes it. Those are caught separately by a
// tree-equality heuristic (possiblySquashMerged) and reported for manual review - never deleted
// automatically, since tree equality is a weaker signal than ancestry.
//
// The freshness of `origin/main` is part of the safety condition, not a courtesy: containment
// measured against a ref fetched an hour ago is a claim about an hour-old world. Every
// assessment therefore refuses unless this checkout fetched within ORIGIN_FRESHNESS_MS.
//
// IGNORED CONTENT - THREE CLASSES, THREE ANSWERS. `git status --porcelain`, the clean-tree test
// every guard here relies on, does not mention ignored files at all, and `git worktree remove`
// deletes them anyway. Measured: a worktree holding `dist/precious.json` and `.env` reports zero
// porcelain lines, removes with exit 0 and no `--force`, and both files are gone. So each
// ignored path is classified and handled, never merely counted:
//   - REGENERABLE (node_modules/, dist/, caches): removed with the worktree, no ceremony.
//   - SECRETS (.env and friends): removed with the worktree, and NEVER read, printed, copied or
//     archived - only their paths are named. A secret is only removable when the primary
//     checkout still has a file at the same path to hand out again; one that exists nowhere else
//     refuses the removal instead.
//   - VALUABLE and unrebuildable (paid bench rounds, generated galleries, eval results):
//     ARCHIVED OUTSIDE THE REPO AND VERIFIED FIRST (scripts/cleanup-archive.mjs). A failed or
//     unprovable copy refuses the removal; no flag overrides it.
//
// LIVENESS. Containment cannot see whether somebody is still sitting in a worktree - a session
// that just landed its branch has a clean tree and a contained branch. scripts/session-liveness.mjs
// answers that from the session transcripts - including the parent-filed ones a worktree-isolated
// subagent writes - and a `locked` worktree (that is how the harness marks an agent RUNNING right
// now) is refused outright rather than forced. Neither signal sees a Codex or plain-shell session,
// which is stated in that file: liveness protects politeness, containment protects work.
//
// Hard rules (never broken, even with --apply):
//   - never `git branch -D`, never `git worktree remove --force`, never touch main or the
//     current branch;
//   - never delete a GitHub branch unless its exact fetched head is protected by a lease and
//     fully contained in both local main and origin/main;
//   - never remove a worktree with uncommitted changes, and never a worktree with NO BRANCH at
//     all: a detached worktree is infrastructure or an investigation in progress, and "its commit
//     is already on main" is the wrong reason to delete either (infrastructureReason);
//   - never remove a worktree whose unrebuildable ignored content has not been archived AND
//     verified, and never one holding a secret that exists nowhere else;
//   - never delete a non-empty unregistered folder (report it for manual review);
//   - only delete managed claude/* or codex/* branches whose commits are fully contained in local
//     main and origin/main, and even then let `git branch -d` refuse as a final backstop.
