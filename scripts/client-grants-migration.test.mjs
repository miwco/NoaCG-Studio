// A table in `public` is UNREACHABLE the moment it is created: Postgres grants a new table to
// nobody but its owner. Hosted Supabase hides that, because its bootstrap sets
//
//   alter default privileges in schema public grant all on tables to anon, authenticated, service_role
//
// so on that one host every table a migration creates arrives already granted, and a migration that
// says nothing about roles still works. Take the same SQL to `supabase start` - the command
// supabase/README.md gives self-hosters - and the schema is inert: `documents` exists, RLS is on,
// the policies are correct, and every signed-in read returns `42501 permission denied for table
// documents`. That shipped from 0001 until 0051 and cost 17 of the 32 configured specs.
//
// This is the guard that makes the omission loud, and it is the mirror image of
// definer-grants.test.mjs: there the inherited grant was MORE than a migration meant to give, here
// it is the only reason the app can read its own rows. A policy that names `anon` or `authenticated`
// for a command is the schema's own statement that the role may run it - so somewhere in the
// migrations there must be a grant that lets it. A policy without its grant can never fire.
