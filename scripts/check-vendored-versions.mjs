// The VENDORED-DEPENDENCY freshness check: everything this repo ships that npm cannot see.
//
// Why this exists: `npm outdated` and `npm audit` only know about entries in package.json. The
// two libraries that reach EVERY user's exported graphic are not entries — GSAP and the Lottie
// player are committed files under src/assets/, bundled locally because a generated template
// must play offline with no CDN reference (root AGENTS.md, principle 3). Nothing warns when
// they go stale, and nothing did: GSAP sat at 3.10.4 while upstream reached 3.15.0, so every
// exported template carried a five-minor-versions-old runtime.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/check-vendored-versions.mjs           # exit 1 if anything is behind or due
//   node scripts/check-vendored-versions.mjs --json    # machine-readable report on stdout
//
// This is NOT in the build gate. It is a time-driven check (weekly-audit.yml) — the answer
// changes when upstream publishes, not when someone commits, so running it per push would only
// re-prove the previous run. Nothing here edits a file; upgrading a vendored library is a
// deliberate human step, because the bundled copy is the one users get and the es2017 output
// floor (docs/CLOUD_PLAYOUT.md §3, CasparCG 2.3.x) has to be re-checked when it moves.
