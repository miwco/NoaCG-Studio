// Do the hosted projects hold every migration this repository has? PRODUCTION, and `noacg-staging`
// beside it.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Migrations live in the repo, but nothing applies them: `supabase db push` is a
// deliberate human act. On 2026-08-25 that gap showed itself - 0051_client_table_grants.sql landed
// on main, was verified against a local stack and against CI, and sat UNAPPLIED on production for
// hours. Nothing anywhere would have said so; it was found by running `supabase migration list`
// for an unrelated reason. A gap that only a coincidence closes is not closed.
//
// WHY IT IS NOT A CI JOB. The migration ledger lives in `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations`,
// which PostgREST does not expose, so reading it remotely needs the Supabase MANAGEMENT API and a
// personal access token. That token is ACCOUNT-WIDE - it enumerates every organisation and
// project, and the same API deletes them - and this repository is public. Putting it in Actions
// would hand a credential far more dangerous than anything the suite was carefully kept away from
// (docs/VERIFICATION.md, configured-suite). So the check runs LOCALLY, where the token already
// lives in .env, at the moment a human is about to land something.
//
// IT NEVER FAILS THE CALLER. Absent credentials, an offline laptop, a slow API: all report and
// exit 0. A check that blocks a landing because someone is on a train is a check people delete.
//
// WHY STAGING IS IN IT TOO. `noacg-staging` is the project the twice-weekly `hosted-latency` job
// runs against, and until 2026-09-02 nothing watched it: it was current only while somebody
// remembered to push it. The teams migrations 0053/0054 then sat unapplied there for a day, and
// the suite went red on a PGRST205 for `public.teams` - which from the failure email is
// indistinguishable from the hosted-only latency regression that job exists to catch. Reporting
// both refs turns "staging is behind" from a twice-weekly red run into a line at landing time,
// which is also where scripts/auto-merge.mjs can act on it.
//
//   node scripts/migration-drift.mjs          # human-readable
//   node scripts/migration-drift.mjs --json   # one JSON line, for the preflight
