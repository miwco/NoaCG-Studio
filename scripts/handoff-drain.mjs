// THE HANDOFF DRAIN - which handoff files the newest wave plan has classified, and which it has not.
//
//   node scripts/handoff-drain.mjs             # every file in docs/handoffs/ with its class and age
//   node scripts/handoff-drain.mjs --check     # exit 1 while any file is unclassified
//   node scripts/handoff-drain.mjs --plan <path>
//   node scripts/handoff-drain.mjs --json
//
// WHY. The orchestrator contract says every handoff file it reads is classified - consumed, spent,
// deferred, or handed to the owner - and that the classification is what makes a deletion safe.
// On 2026-09-01 a planner classified thirteen files as spent from their headings; four were not,
// and one held the only analysis of an unfixed defect. The rule existed; nothing observed whether
// it had been applied. This script does: it reads the `## Handoffs` section of the newest wave
// plan (the gitignored wave-state file the orchestrator writes) and lists every file in
// `docs/handoffs/` that the section does not mention. An undrained folder is then a printed line
// rather than a thing to remember.
//
// THE FOUR CLASSES, one line each under `## Handoffs` in the wave plan:
//
//   - consumed: 2026-09-01-a-thing.md -> row B
//   - spent: 2026-09-01-d-thing.md - every open item traced: <where each now lives>
//   - deferred: 2026-08-30-n-thing.md - <why not this wave>
//   - owner: 2026-09-02-x-thing.md -> needs-you / owner-queue item <name>
//
// `consumed` means a prompt in this wave was written from it; `spent` that every open item has
// been traced to where it now lives; `deferred` that it is machine-continuable but not this wave;
// `owner` that its open items need a person and have been routed to the report or the owner
// queue. Consumed, spent and owner files are deleted by exactly one wave row; a deferred file
// older than DEFERRED_STALE_DAYS is flagged, because the backlog's graduate-or-die rule applies to
// handoffs too.
//
// Read-only. It never deletes a handoff and never edits the plan.
