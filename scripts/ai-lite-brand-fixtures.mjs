// The frozen BRAND fixture bank: the marks a user brings, and the briefs that bring them.
//
// It lives in the repo rather than in `lite-eval-out/` because everything under that directory
// is gitignored and dies with its worktree - and a paid round whose inputs are gone cannot be
// re-read, which is exactly what happened to the 2026-08-08 Pro round's twelve interpretations
// (src/ai/AGENTS.md, "NoaCG Pro").
//
// Two consumers, deliberately sharing one bank:
//   - `scripts/ai-lite-brand-audit.mjs` - the FREE geometry/contrast audit. Spends nothing.
//   - a future paid Lite round, which sends the same marks with the same briefs, so the
//     rendered result can be compared against a measurement that already exists.
//
// The marks are AUTHORED SVG, not fetched or uploaded: an audit that depends on a file
// somebody has to supply measures whatever that person happened to have. Each one is a real
// mark SHAPE that a slot can get wrong in a different way - a wide lockup letterboxes to a
// thin strip in a square well, a tall mark overflows one, a knockout mark disappears on a
// pale panel. `tone` says which backdrops the mark can legally sit on, and `inkHex` is the
// colour its contrast is judged on; both are declared because the SVG is authored here, so
// nothing has to guess them back out of the pixels.

/**
 * `tone`:
 *   'dark'  - the mark's ink is DARK, so it needs a LIGHT surface under it.
 *   'light' - the mark's ink is LIGHT (a knockout), so it needs a DARK surface.
 *   'both'  - the mark carries its own field and reads either way.
 * A real brand kit ships more than one of these, which is why a graphic has to say which
 * surface it offers rather than assuming the file will cope.
 *
 * `shape` is the bucket `LiteMarkShape` sorts this aspect into (src/ai/lite/types.ts owns the
 * cuts: portrait <0.85, square <=1.4, wordmark <=4.5, rail above). Declared rather than derived
 * because these five SVGs are authored here, and because the audit is a .mjs script that cannot
 * import the TypeScript that owns the boundaries - so the data lives here and the logic lives
 * there, rather than the boundaries living in both.
 *
 * `inkHex` is the colour that has to READ; `fieldHex` is the mark's own background, or null
 * when the mark is transparent. The pair matters because they are two different physical
 * questions and only one of them can be failed. A transparent lockup composites its ink
 * straight onto whatever the design gives it, so a knockout mark on a pale panel is simply
 * gone - measurable, and fatal. A mark carrying its own field cannot disappear; the worst it
 * can do is sit on a surface too close to that field to separate, which is a much lower floor.
 * Judging both against the surface at 3:1 was the audit's own first bug: it failed a crest with
 * a white ring and a white star for being dark blue on blue.
