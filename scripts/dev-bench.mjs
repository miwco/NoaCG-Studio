// `npm run dev:bench` - the dev server the video bench drives, wrapped so that when it dies
// it leaves a trace.
//
// Why the wrapper exists: during a 42-generation bench pass this server vanished twice,
// mid-run, taking a brief's worth of paid generations with it. Both times the process was
// simply gone - `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`, no entry left in the preview harness, no logs - so
// there was nothing to diagnose from. A dev server that dies unattended is only debuggable if
// something recorded how it went, and the exit code or signal is the whole question: a signal
// means something outside reaped it, a non-zero code with "heap out of memory" means Vite ran
// out of room, and a clean 0 means it was asked to stop.
//
// Output is passed through UNCHANGED so the preview harness still reads Vite's ready banner
// and port the way it always has; the log file is a copy, never a replacement.
//
// Three things get recorded, because they fail in different ways:
//   - Vite's own stdout/stderr, streamed as it arrives. A crash that PRINTS (V8's "FATAL
//     ERROR: ... heap out of memory" goes to stderr) lands here even if nothing else runs.
//   - the exit code/signal, when the wrapper gets to see it.
//   - a heartbeat, because often it does NOT. Windows has no real SIGTERM: a supervisor
//     stop is a TerminateProcess, the handlers below never fire, and the log simply stops.
//     Verified here - stopping the server through the preview harness wrote no exit line at
//     all. So the heartbeat is what distinguishes the two cases that matter: a log ending
//     with a crash message means Vite died of something it could describe, and a log ending
//     at a heartbeat means it was killed from outside without a word.
