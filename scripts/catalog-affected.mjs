// WHICH DESIGNS DID THIS CHANGE TOUCH - so a catalog run costs what the change cost, not what
// the catalog costs.
//
// The five catalog gates MEASURE a rendered graphic, one browser page at a time, over 500+
// designs. That is right, and it is why they are the only checks that catch a visibly broken
// catalog - but it also means a comment fix in one lower third used to re-measure every design
// in the set. The owner's complaint on 2026-08-28 was exactly this: any template change "takes a
// lot of effort from the computer and everything else", and the catalog only grows.
//
// So this answers WHICH designs, and every gate now takes `--only <ids>`:
//
//   node scripts/catalog-affected.mjs             # the plan, in words
//   node scripts/catalog-affected.mjs --json      # the plan, for a script to consume
//   node scripts/catalog-affected.mjs --ids       # just the ids, comma-separated, for --only
//   node scripts/catalog-affected.mjs <base-ref>  # diff against an explicit base
//   node scripts/catalog-affected.mjs --integration      # force the fork point (see below)
//   node scripts/catalog-affected.mjs --no-integration   # force the branch-only base
//
// AFTER TAKING MAIN IN, the base moves to the FORK POINT on its own, so the plan is the union of
// both sides' designs rather than only this branch's - `merge-base HEAD main` IS main once the
// merge exists, and a pre-land gate planning from it would name too few designs with nothing
// going red. Same rule and the same implementation as `scripts/e2e-affected.mjs` (imported).
//
// HOW IT DECIDES, AND WHERE IT FAILS.
//
// WHETHER the catalog is affected at all is not decided here: `scripts/e2e-affected.mjs`
// already owns that question (its CATALOG_TRIGGERS, plus the core escalation), it is tested, and
// CI branches on it. This module imports that answer and adds only WHICH.
//
// WHICH comes from the catalog's own shape, in two steps, both read off the source rather than
// curated - so a design added, moved or renamed re-maps itself with no list to update.
//
//   1. DECLARATIONS. Every design declares itself with a literal `id: 'lt01'` in one file under
//      src/templates, so a changed file contributes the designs declared in it.
//   2. IMPORTERS. Designs are not islands: `tickers/tk07.ts` calls `houseWire` out of
//      `tickers/tk05.ts` as its entire `create` body, so editing tk05 changes what EIGHT designs
//      emit. If a change to a file can move design D at all, D's own code must depend on it - so
//      following importers and collecting every declaration on the way is complete, not merely
//      cautious. The walk passes THROUGH files that declare nothing (`index.ts`,
//      `types/registry.ts`, `catalog.ts`), because those aggregate rather than author.
//
// EVERYTHING ELSE ESCALATES TO THE WHOLE CATALOG, and that is the safety property: a changed
// file that declares no design (a category's `shared.ts`, a preset bank, the type registry, the
// motion runtime, the `:root` contract, fonts, the theme tokens, the bench) is shared machinery
// whose blast radius is the whole set, and a file this script cannot attribute at all is treated
// the same way. Like e2e-affected, it fails toward measuring MORE - the one failure mode with no
// alarm attached is measuring less.
