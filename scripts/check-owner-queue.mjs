// THE OWNER QUEUE'S TWO KEYS, AND THIS IS WHAT KEEPS THEM THERE.
//
//   node scripts/check-owner-queue.mjs        # part of `npm run build`
//
// `docs/acceptance/OWNER_QUEUE.md` ("The shape of an item") says every file under
// `docs/acceptance/owner-queue/` opens with front matter carrying `kind:` (one of KINDS below)
// and `date:`. `.agent-workflows/walk.md` step 2 reads those two keys to pick the list an item
// goes in, sort it newest-first, filter it (`/walk hardware`) and skip `done: true` items. On
// 2026-09-02, 30 of 59 files carried neither key, so more than half the queue could not be
// sorted or filtered by the mechanism its own contract describes - the documented shape was
// untrue, and nothing said so.
//
// Narrow on purpose: this checks that the two keys are present, that `kind:` is a value `/walk`
// understands, and that an OPTIONAL `serves:` - the whole priority mechanism, so a typo in it
// silently sorts an item last - reads `now` if it is there at all. It does not check the route,
// the "what to look at" line, or anything else the shape doc describes, so a red here always has
// a one-line fix: add the missing key, or correct the value.
//
// Every rule is a WIDENING or a check on a key nobody has written yet, never a new requirement.
// Sessions file items into this directory while branches are in flight, and a tightening reds
// their builds for a line their prompt never saw.
//
// Reuses parseFrontmatter from scripts/owner-receipts.mjs, the one front-matter parser for the
// repo's own markdown, rather than writing a second one.

 * Each value answers ONE question - who can settle this item - so a filing session can pick it
 * without judgement about importance. See OWNER_QUEUE.md, "Which kind does an item get".
 *
 * Widened on 2026-09-02 from `walk` / `owner-action` / `hardware`, by adding `walk-p` (the owner
 * can answer it from his phone) and `agent` (an agent settles it by driving the product). The
 * three older values still pass unchanged: this is a WIDENING, so no item filed against the
 * earlier vocabulary goes red for a value its session never saw.

 * The only value `serves:` may carry. It marks an item whose work serves the `## NOW` push in

/**
 * WHY an `owner-action` item is his, and the only four answers there are. The owner ruled on
 * 2026-09-04 that a TECHNICAL problem is never his - a red main, a branch that will not land, a
 * stuck queue, a worktree in a bad state, a dependency to upgrade - because he has no skill there
 * that an agent lacks, and routing one to him means he asks an AI and pastes the answer back.
 * Every one of those is ours, including the ones we have not solved yet.
 *
 * So the kind alone stopped being enough. `owner-action` was the bucket everything hard fell
 * into, and a closed vocabulary is what makes the fall visible: an item that cannot name one of
 * these four is not his, and filing it is the bug this gate catches.
 *
 * - account  - credentials or a console we do not hold.
 * - money    - it costs money, or publishes past `main` where a later commit cannot undo it.
 * - identity - he must speak or sign as himself or as the organisation.
 * - harness  - the agent harness refuses it by design, and the item says which refusal it hit.
 *
 * Full definitions and the ruling: `docs/acceptance/OWNER_QUEUE.md`, "A TECHNICAL problem is
 * never his".

 * while their branches are in flight and a tightening reds a build for a line the prompt never
 * saw. Requiring a new key is a genuine tightening, so it is date-gated instead: an item filed
 * before this date is read exactly as it always was, and only items filed from this date on have
 * to carry it. The key is validated against NEEDS whenever it is present, at any date, since a
 * misspelt value would be worse than an absent one.
