// THE PHANTOM-DIRTY FILE, CAUGHT AND NAMED INSTEAD OF PUZZLED OVER.
//
//   node scripts/check-line-endings.mjs        # part of `npm run build`
//
// WHAT IT LOOKS FOR. A file `git status` calls MODIFIED that `git diff` does not mention at all.
// That is not a paradox and it is not a git bug: on a Windows checkout `core.autocrlf=true` writes
// the working copy with CRLF and caches that size in the index, while every generator in
// `scripts/` writes plain "\n". After the generator runs, the bytes on disk no longer match what
// the index recorded, so status marks the file dirty - and then `git diff` runs the content
// through the clean filter, gets back the very blob already stored, and reports nothing. Nothing
// changed; the file just looks changed. `git update-index --refresh` does not clear it. The fix is
// an `eol=lf` entry in `.gitattributes`, which makes checkout write what the generator writes.
//
// THE TWO SOURCES MUST BOTH BE READ, and the first version of this file read only one. It asked
// `git diff --numstat` for rows of `0 0` - modified, no lines changed - which is what a phantom
// sounds like and is not what it looks like: the clean filter means a phantom produces no numstat
// row whatsoever. Measured by manufacturing one (README.md rewritten with LF): ` M README.md` in
// status, an empty diff, and a gate that said everything was fine. The disagreement BETWEEN the
// two commands is the signal - neither one carries it alone.
//
// WHY IT IS A GATE. `merge-order.mjs` and `safe-merge-preflight.mjs` both refuse to act on a dirty
// worktree, correctly - they cannot tell a phantom from real uncommitted work, and neither can a
// person reading `git status`. On 2026-08-21 that marked two branches NOT LANDABLE over zero
// changed lines and stopped a safe-merge run mid-flight. `.gitattributes` fixes each case as it is
// found; this is what stops the list going stale, because a generator nobody thought to declare
// announces itself the first time somebody runs it.
//
// WHAT IT CANNOT SEE. A generator that has never been RUN in this checkout has left no phantom to
// find, so a new one still reaches `main` undeclared and surfaces later, on somebody's laptop, in
// the middle of a landing. This narrows that window rather than closing it. It is also silent on
// Linux, where `core.autocrlf` is off and the phenomenon does not exist - which is why it is a
// local gate that happens to run in CI, not a CI gate.
//
// IT CHANGES NOTHING. Two git reads, no writes.

 *
 * A path containing a space, a quote or a non-ASCII byte comes back C-quoted (`"src/a b.ts"`).
