// START THE DEV SERVER FOR *THIS* CHECKOUT - the sanctioned path in a linked worktree.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. `npm run dev` is refused by scripts/hooks/guard-command.mjs, and the
// alternative that refusal used to name - `preview_start {name: "dev"}` - does not reach a
// linked worktree. Measured 2026-09-01 from `.claude/worktrees/agent-a32e0b6091a2fe4bb`
// (reserved port 5256), one call, three different checkouts in the answer:
//
//   - it spawned `npm run dev` with cwd `.claude/worktrees/new-session-64a3f6` - the LAUNCHING
//     session's checkout, not the one the work is in;
//   - it reported `port: 5174` - the PRIMARY checkout's number, from neither of the above;
//   - Vite actually bound 5240 - the reservation of the checkout it was spawned in, because
//     vite.config.ts resolves the port from its own location and that part is correct;
//   - nothing ever answered on the reported port, so the harness reaped the server about two
//     minutes later. Net result: no server at all, and the only URL the session was handed
//     pointed at a checkout it was not working in.
//
// So a worktree session had no correct way to drive its own build: the guard refused the direct
// route and the sanctioned route served somebody else's tree. That is the "green gate on the
// wrong tree" shape the root AGENTS.md calls worse than a red one, and it has already been paid
// for - the 2026-08-29 SVG import sweep measured main's importer rather than the branch's and
// said so in its own report (docs/backlog/svg-import-sweep-findings.md).
//
// WHAT KEEPS THE REFUSAL HONEST. The guard refuses hand-started servers for a real reason:
// Playwright runs with `reuseExistingServer: true`, so a stray server on a checkout's port is
// silently adopted along with whatever env it was started with. This script does not widen that
// rule, it is the rule made mechanical:
//
//   - the checkout is resolved from THIS FILE's location, never `process.cwd()`, so the copy
//     that ships in a worktree can only ever serve that worktree;
//   - the port is that checkout's RESERVATION (scripts/dev-port.mjs) - the same number Vite,
//     both Playwright configs, the guard hook and every dev script derive, with no second
//     source of it;
//   - it REFUSES when that port is already busy, which is the actual hazard the guard names.
//
// The only server it can start is therefore on the port that checkout already owns, serving the
// tree the work is in. It is NOT the suite's server: `playwright.config.ts` pins the backend and
// AI vars empty for its own, and this one carries the ambient `.env`, which is exactly why the
// two must never be confused for each other (see the mutual exclusion below). It runs in the
// FOREGROUND so
// the shell that started it owns it (background it with the tool's own backgrounding, then stop
// it by stopping that task).
//
// STOPPING THE SHELL TASK DOES NOT ALWAYS TAKE VITE WITH IT. An interrupt is forwarded (the
// signal handlers below), but a hard kill of the wrapper on Windows leaves the grandchild
// running and holding the port. It spawns the real `vite/bin/vite.js` so that leftover is at
// least VISIBLE to `node scripts/e2e-runs.mjs --orphans` like any other.
//
// THAT LIST IS A PLACE TO LOOK, NOT A VERDICT, and this script must not pretend otherwise:
//   - a LIVE server can appear in it. `chainIsOrphaned` asks whether the launch chain above the
//     process still exists, and a backgrounded shell task whose launcher has since exited has no
//     living chain even while the server is serving. Measured both ways on 2026-09-01: from this
//     session's own backgrounding a healthy server was correctly absent from the list, and from
//     a forked review session a healthy server was reported as orphaned.
//   - the checkout it names can be wrong. `rootOfCommand` reads the path in front of
//     `node_modules`, and a linked worktree with no node_modules of its own resolves the primary
//     checkout's Vite - so the server is attributed to the primary checkout, which is that
//     function's own documented behaviour rather than something to fix here.
//   - `--orphans` run from the PRIMARY checkout covers every worktree under it, so a kill there
//     is not scoped to the caller.
// Together that is why the busy-port message below says look, identify, and only then close -
// telling anyone to reach for `--kill-orphans` on a port they cannot attribute would contradict
// the very rule this file is about.
//
// A RUNNING SERVER BLOCKS THIS CHECKOUT'S E2E RUNS, deliberately: the guard hook's port check
// refuses them while the port is taken, because Playwright would adopt this server and its
// ambient .env instead of starting one with the offline-pinned vars its config sets. So a sweep
// and a suite in the same checkout are mutually exclusive - stop this before running specs.
//
// CLI:
//   node scripts/dev-worktree.mjs        start the server for this checkout (npm run dev:worktree)
//   node scripts/dev-worktree.mjs --print  print where it WOULD serve, start nothing
