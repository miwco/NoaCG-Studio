// WHO ELSE IS RUNNING PLAYWRIGHT RIGHT NOW - across every checkout of this repo on this machine.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Several worktrees are normally live at once (scripts/worktree-activity.mjs
// exists for exactly that), and each one's Playwright config asks for 4 workers. Two sessions
// deciding to run their suites in the same minute therefore asks the box for EIGHT parallel
// browser workers plus two Vite servers - measured on a Ryzen 7 5800H / 16 GB laptop as 34
// live `chrome-headless-shell` processes, 93% CPU and under 2 GB of free RAM. Neither run is
// wrong; the collision is. Nobody chose it, and nobody could see it: each session only knows
// about its own checkout, and the dev-port registry deliberately keeps them off each other's
// ports, so the usual "port is busy" signal never fires.
//
// WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not a lock file. A lock has to be released, and the thing holding it
// is a shell command that can be killed, time out, or be interrupted mid-run - so a stale lock
// would block every future run until someone deleted it by hand. Instead we ask the OS what is
// actually running. That answer is self-cleaning by construction: a killed run stops being
// reported the moment its process is gone.
//
// WHAT COUNTS AS A RUN. The top-level Playwright CLI (`@playwright/test/cli.js test ...`), one
// per run, whatever config or spec list it was given. Worker processes and browser shells are
// deliberately NOT counted: they are children of that CLI, so counting them would report one
// run many times, and a lingering browser without its CLI is an orphan (see --orphans), not a
// run in progress.
//
// CLI:
//   node scripts/e2e-runs.mjs            list active runs; exit 1 if any, 0 if none
//   node scripts/e2e-runs.mjs --json     the same as one machine-readable object
//   node scripts/e2e-runs.mjs --wait     block until no run is active, then exit 0
//   node scripts/e2e-runs.mjs --orphans  list browser/worker processes and DEV SERVERS with no
//                                        live CLI to belong to
//   node scripts/e2e-runs.mjs --kill-orphans   close them, freeing the RAM and the e2e port
