// What everything ELSE in this checkout is currently working on.
//
// Several worktrees are normally active at once (see AGENTS.md), so "is anyone already on
// this?" is a question both the SessionStart hook and the shared `next` workflow need to
// answer, from the same rules. The answer has TWO halves, and only reporting the first one
// leaves a hole big enough to walk into:
//
//   - WORKTREES with files in flight: uncommitted working-tree changes, or commits on their
//     branch that `main` does not have yet. This is live work, someone is probably in it now.
//   - BRANCHES ahead of `main` that no worktree currently has checked out. A session that
//     ends leaves its branch behind, and the client parks the freed worktree on a detached
//     HEAD - so unmerged work stays unmerged while becoming invisible to a worktree-only
//     scan. Observed in practice: a branch 4 commits and 26 files ahead vanished from this
//     scan the moment its session closed.
//
// This is READ-ONLY and best-effort. It never blocks anything: two sessions touching one file
// is not automatically a problem, it is just something worth knowing before starting work.
//
// Speed matters here, because `next` runs it while the user waits. Two things keep it quick:
// the whole-checkout facts are read ONCE up front (each worktree's branch and HEAD come from
// `git worktree list`, every branch's tip subject and age from a single `for-each-ref`), and
// the per-worktree calls that remain run CONCURRENTLY. Sequentially, ~5 git spawns per
// worktree over ~9 worktrees took 4-7s on Windows - `git status` alone is up to 1.5s on a
// large or freshly-built tree, and that latency is all waiting, not work.
//
// CLI (no arguments): print the live snapshot for the checkout you run it from.
