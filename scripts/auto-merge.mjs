// LAND ONE BRANCH, MECHANICALLY - the boring path of the safe-merge workflow, as a command a
// job runner can spawn.
//
//   node scripts/auto-merge.mjs --branch <branch> [--dry-run] [--no-wait] [--no-db-push] [--onto-red-main]
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. `.agent-workflows/safe-merge.md` is a procedure for a reader: it stops for
// judgement calls, and most of a landing is not a judgement call. Queued as
// `jobs.mjs add "node scripts/auto-merge.mjs --branch <b>" --kind merge`, several branches drain
// overnight in merge order, one at a time, and the owner wakes up to them landed.
//
// WHAT IT WILL NOT DO, and this is the whole design. It refuses - loudly, changing nothing
// further - on every case where the workflow would have asked a person:
//
//   - a merge-order verdict that is not `clear` (a stacked branch, a duplicate migration
//     number, a rename over another branch's edits - the cases the old collisions came from);
//   - any failed check in `safe-merge-preflight.mjs` phase 1, 3 or 4;
//   - a dirty worktree on either side;
//   - a CONFLICT integrating main (it aborts the merge and stops);
//   - a red, missing, damaged or shard-skipping CI run;
//   - MAIN ITSELF being red (`scripts/main-health.mjs`, exit 4) - see below;
//   - main moving under it at any point.
//
// It never force-pushes, never resets, never deletes a branch or a worktree, and the only merge
// it makes into main is `--ff-only`, which git refuses unless the branch already contains main.
//
// Publishing PAST main - npm publish, money - is never done here. MIGRATIONS ARE THE EXCEPTION,
// and deliberately so since 2026-08-25: after a successful landing this applies whatever
// production is missing, through `scripts/db-push.mjs`, which classifies every statement and
// refuses anything that can remove something. So the unattended run can do strictly less than an
// attended one, and the thing it removes is the gap where a landed migration waits for somebody
// to remember it. A refusal is reported and never fails the landing. `--no-db-push` opts out.
// `noacg-staging` gets the same treatment after production, since 2026-09-02 - it drifted the
// same way and only a twice-weekly red run said so, a day late and wearing the wrong diagnosis.
