//
// `gemini-3.7-flash-high` is the DEFAULT MODEL the owner ruled for on 2026-08-30 (3/3 correct and
// 3.3x faster than gemini-3.1-pro-high on the same question - docs/HARNESS_ROUTING.md). It cannot
// be a real default here because `--model` is required for attribution, see below; pass it.
// Every path in the PROMPT must be absolute, or the run reads an unknown checkout.
//
// WHY A WRAPPER AT ALL. `agy` is the only one of the three harnesses that keeps NO cumulative
// usage anywhere on disk. Codex writes `token_count` events into its rollouts and Claude Code
// writes `message.usage` into its transcripts, so `scripts/harness-usage.mjs` can read both after
// the fact. `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/` holds a conversation store, an annotation, a metadata
// cache and logs, and a text scan of all of them finds no token field at all (measured
// 2026-08-30, docs/HARNESS_ROUTING.md). There is no `agy usage` subcommand and no headless quota
// surface either. Per-run usage exists on stdout, once, and then it is gone. So the money's worth
// is unanswerable unless the CALL captures its own receipt - which is this script.
//
// WHERE THE LEDGER LIVES, AND WHY. `~/.noacg/agy-usage.jsonl`, overridable with
// `NOACG_AGY_LEDGER`. Deliberately OUTSIDE the repository:
//
//   - a worktree is disposable. Ignored files die with it (`.agent-workflows/cleanup-worktrees.md`
//     exists because that loss is real), and this is the one record of spend that cannot be
//     re-derived from anything;
//   - spend is per MACHINE, not per checkout. A ledger in the tree would be one ledger per
//     worktree, so the answer to "what did Antigravity cost today" would depend on where you
//     stood;
//   - an ignore rule is a thing to forget. A path outside the repo cannot be committed by
//     accident, so there is no rule to keep in step;
//   - it matches the other two harnesses. `harness-usage.mjs` already reads `~/.codex` and
//     `~/.claude` off `homedir()`, and the third reader is the same shape because the third
//     source sits in the same place.
//
// One JSON line per call, append-only, `v: 1`. A FAILED call is recorded too: a run whose tools
// were all auto-denied still spends ~18 K input tokens, and a meter that hid those would flatter
// the harness exactly where it is being judged.
//
// THREE REFUSALS, all deliberate:
//
//   1. `--model` is REQUIRED. The agy result object does not name the model that answered, so a
//      call that did not pin one can never be attributed afterwards. The ledger would carry a
//      number with no idea what produced it.
//   2. `--label` is REQUIRED (2026-09-01). The one call ever made on the ruled default model
//      recorded `label: null` - spend nobody can connect to the work it paid for, which defeats
//      the outcome routing the ledger exists to feed (docs/ORCHESTRATION_NEXT.md §6).
//   3. `--dangerously-skip-permissions` is REJECTED, not forwarded. It is in agy's help output;
//      it is a capability, not an instruction.
//
// AND ONE POSTURE (2026-09-01): the call runs `--mode plan` - agy's read-only planning mode -
// unless `--write` is passed, which omits the mode flag and restores exactly the measured write
// path (grants in ~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json still scope WHERE it may write). The
// machine-global write grants mean a bare call could otherwise edit a worktree nobody asked it
// to; this is the same shape as /rescue, where a run is read-only unless the request says
// otherwise.
//
// AND THE WRITE SCOPE (2026-09-03, owner: Antigravity may be a real implementation worker, and
// its writes must be scoped to the assigned worktree and go through the same review, gate and
// serialized landing as Claude and Codex work). What that is worth saying plainly: agy's own
// permission grants are MACHINE-GLOBAL, so nothing in this wrapper is a sandbox. What it does
// instead is refuse the runs whose blast radius is shared, and make what a write actually did
// visible to the session that has to review it:
//
//   - a write must run in a LINKED WORKTREE. The primary checkout is the landing queue's tree -
//     it is checked out, merged, built and reset during every integration, so a delegate writing
//     there can lose work that is not its own (root AGENTS.md, "Git");
//   - a write must run on a BRANCH that is not `main`, and never on a detached HEAD. That is the
//     whole of "it lands the same way everything else does": whatever it writes sits on a feature
//     branch some Claude row gates, reviews and queues, and reaches `main` through the queue;
//   - and every write run prints the files it changed, from a `git status` taken before and after.
//     A delegated diff nobody read is not reviewed work, and the reviewer needs the file list
//     before the ledger line is worth anything.
//
// AND ONE TRAP THIS SCRIPT EXISTS TO CATCH: `status: SUCCESS` with exit code 0 and an EMPTY
// `response` is agy's way of saying it produced no answer at all. Two causes are known, both
// measured on this machine, and they need different fixes:
//
//   - every tool call auto-denied. There is no prompt to answer in print mode, so a tool with no
//     allow-rule is refused silently. Only `read_file`, `command` and `write_file` are real grant
//     actions - `list_dir`, `grep_search` and `codebase_search` are accepted into the settings
//     file and then dropped as invalid, which only the agy log ever says;
//   - `--print-timeout` (default 5m) reached mid-task. Nothing is returned and everything is
//     billed: one such run here cost 202 K input and 1.56 M cache reads for an empty string.
//
// Both are FAILURES here, and the elapsed time picks which diagnosis leads.

Calls Google's Antigravity CLI and records what it cost, because agy keeps no cumulative usage
anywhere on disk. Read the ledger back with: npm run harness:usage

  --model <id>          REQUIRED. agy's result never names the model that answered, so a call
                        that does not pin one can never be attributed. See \`agy models\`.
  --label <text>        REQUIRED. What the call is for, stored on the ledger line - spend with
                        no label cannot feed outcome routing.
  --write               allow writes. Without it the call runs \`--mode plan\` (read-only). A write
                        run must be in a LINKED WORKTREE on a branch that is not main, and it
                        prints the files it changed so they can be reviewed before they land.
  --read-only           refuse --write outright. \`npm run agy:read\` passes this itself, which
                        is what makes that door safe to pre-approve.
