// WHICH CHECKOUT DOES THIS SHELL COMMAND ACT ON? - the one place that decides.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS. Several worktrees of this repo are normally live at once, each with its OWN dev
// port, its own dist/ and its own branch. Anything that judges a command - the guard hook above
// all - has to answer that question about the checkout the command TARGETS, and the session's own
// directory is not that answer. Four separate defects on 2026-08-29 were the same mistake:
//
//   - `npm run test:e2e:integration:queued` was refused four times because the guard checked port
//     5174, the MAIN checkout's port, while the run it was about to allow would have used 5202,
//     this worktree's (docs/handoffs/2026-08-29-cc-playout-polish.md). A session whose own
//     directory is the main checkout gets that refusal for as long as anybody has a dev server up
//     there, which is most of the time.
//   - the code-review skill reviewed a DIFFERENT worktree's branch three times, reporting findings
//     about somebody else's diff (docs/handoffs/2026-08-29-dd-svg-fitting-two.md).
//   - `preview_start` serves whichever checkout the session sits in, so a sweep needing a dev
//     server could not be run from a session sitting elsewhere.
//
// Only the first is fixed by code alone; what they share is a tool reading the session's cwd where
// it meant the target's root. `scripts/hooks/session-start.mjs` already resolves the checkout the
// right way and comments that it is "correct per-worktree"; this module is that answer made
// reusable, and made to honour what the command itself says about where it will run.
//
// THE RULE, in order of authority:
//   1. an explicit `cd` / `pushd` / `Set-Location` chain in the command, resolved segment by
//      segment - `cd <worktree> && npm run test:e2e` acts on <worktree>, whatever the session's
//      own directory is;
//   2. an absolute path the command names for the thing it runs - `node C:/…/wt/scripts/l3-sweep.mjs`,
//      `npm --prefix C:/…/wt run x`, `--config C:/…/wt/playwright.config.ts`;
//   3. the base directory it was asked about (the session's cwd), which is right whenever the
//      command says nothing.
//
// The result is then turned into a CHECKOUT ROOT by git itself, so a path anywhere inside a
// worktree resolves to that worktree and a path outside every checkout resolves to nothing.

// so `isAbsolute('C:/repo')` is false on Linux and `dirname('C:\\a\\b')` is `.` there. That is
// invisible on this machine and fails in CI, which is where these tests actually run. Everything
// below is therefore textual over a forward-slash normalisation, and gives the same answer on
