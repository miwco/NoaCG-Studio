// THE OWNER RECEIPT - owner-raised work that survives a forgetful planner.
//
//   node scripts/owner-receipts.mjs               # open receipts: asks first, unstarted and oldest first
//   node scripts/owner-receipts.mjs --check       # validate the receipts (part of `npm run build`)
//   node scripts/owner-receipts.mjs --closed      # receipts deleted from git history, i.e. landed
//   node scripts/owner-receipts.mjs --serves <branch>   # what this branch does to the receipts it owns
//   node scripts/owner-receipts.mjs --json
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-09-01 the owner asked for a row by name (the AGENTS.md byte headroom),
// the plan held it for the night wave, the night wave was replanned by a different session, and
// the row was never launched. Nothing in the repository knew it had been asked for: the ask lived
// in a chat, a memory file and a gitignored wave plan, each of which a later planner may never
// read. A task the owner raised must be knowable from the repository alone - who raised it, when,
// what was actually asked, and where it stands - and every plan must see the standing ones with
// their age. This script is that receipt.
//
// WHAT A RECEIPT IS. Not a second issue tracker: it is the existing `docs/backlog/` file with a
// small front matter block on top (docs/backlog/README.md, "Owner receipts"):
//
//   ---
//   v: 2
//   source: owner             # owner | derived - `derived` says out loud that this is NOT an ask
//   kind: ask                 # ask | finding
//   raised: 2026-09-01
//   state: unstarted          # unstarted | advanced | active | parked | superseded
//   branch: claude/x-thing    # required while active
//   note: what landed, or why it waits   # required for advanced, parked and superseded
//   asked: >-                 # `asked:` on an ask, `found:` on a finding - never both
//     the owner's own words, or a paraphrase marked as one
//   ---
//
// TWO THINGS A RECEIPT MUST NOT CONFLATE, both paid for on 2026-09-03 and 2026-09-04.
//
//   `kind:` - an ASK is a thing the owner wants; a FINDING is a bug or a question that turned up
//   while serving one. Version 1 printed both under the heading `asked:`, so a defect he mentioned
//   in passing read as a requirement he had issued, and once a number is written under his name
//   nobody argues with it again. Owner, 2026-09-03: "distinguish between things I explicitly asked
//   for and bugs/findings that arose while pursuing those asks. Those can absolutely remain work,
//   but don't turn them into owner requirements retroactively." A finding's quote therefore lives
//   under `found:`, and `--check` refuses a finding that carries `asked:` at all. Only asks are
//   what the wave plan check insists a plan account for.
//
//   `advanced` - work landed against this receipt and the ask still stands, with no branch owning
//   it. Version 1 had no word for that, so `cloud-sessions-for-stateless-rows` (real measurement
//   landed, ask untouched) counted as `unstarted` beside a genuinely untouched item and beside six
//   whose work was finished. The one number a planner steers by was drifting in the direction that
//   manufactures work.
//
// Landed is STILL not a state: the file is deleted in the commit that lands the work, exactly as
// the backlog README says ("graduate or die"), and `--closed` reads those deletions back out of git
// so a landed receipt is still findable. `--serves` is what keeps that true at the moment rather
// than whenever a planner notices - see its own comment. A file whose Source line credits the owner
// but carries no front matter FAILS `--check`: the point is that an owner ask cannot sit in the
// backlog without a receipt, and a convention nothing checks is a wish.
//
// Read-only except for stdout. Never edits a backlog file, never touches git state.
