// WHAT A STARVED RUNNER MAY RECLAIM, AND WHAT STAYS A PERSON'S CALL.
//
// The queue stops starting work below a free-RAM floor, which is right - two suites on a 16 GB
// laptop take it to 35 MB free rather than sharing it. What was missing is the other half: when
// nothing can start for a quarter of an hour, SOMETHING is holding the memory, and on this
// machine it is routinely nothing at all - a killed run's browser shells, a dev server whose CLI
// was taken away, the `cmd /c` shims above it. Those hold gigabytes and belong to nobody, and the
// queue used to wait for them as patiently as it waits for real work.
//
// THE RULE, AND IT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN: this kills only processes a NAMED detector has already
// proved orphaned, and it fails CLOSED - anything the classifier does not recognise is kept,
// including a process it merely suspects. Sessions are never closed and never asked to close
// themselves; what is left holding the RAM is NAMED and left alone, because "which of my windows
// should I shut" is a judgement about work in flight that no classifier can make.
//
// The detectors live in `e2e-runs.mjs` (`orphanProcesses`, `orphanedDevServers`), which already
// answers "is this a leftover?" for `--kill-orphans` and only ever says yes when NO Playwright
// CLI is running at all. This module is the decision layer over them: when to look, what may be
// killed, and what to say about the rest.
