// The notice that fires when a handoff is destroyed. Both directions are pinned because both are
// expensive in opposite ways:
//
//   too shy   - a handoff holding the only copy of an analysis is deleted and nothing says so.
//               That happened on 2026-09-01: thirteen files were classified `spent` from their
//               headings, four were not, and one held the only analysis of an unfixed OGraf
//               defect. It was restored by hand.
//   too eager - a wave row whose whole job is to drain the folder gets a notice per file, and a
//               session updating its own handoff gets one every time. A notice that fires on the
//               ordinary case is a notice people stop reading, and this one has no other use.
