//
// `docs/README.md` calls itself "the map of this directory", and a session reads it to find out
// whether a subject is already written down. On 2026-08-30 it carried 59 rows for 110 files, and
// said nothing about the gap - so a missing row read as "no doc exists", and the session either
// re-derived something already measured or wrote a second doc on the same subject. Two docs on
// one subject is how contracts start contradicting each other. A warning in the header would
// only stop the wrong inference; a list is the instrument, and a list nothing watches drifts
// back within a month, which is how it drifted this far.
//
// Three rules, and each fails CLOSED - the check names the files and exits non-zero:
//
//  1. MISSING - a top-level `docs/*.md` with no row. The map claims completeness, so this is
//     the rule the map is about. Subdirectories are deliberately exempt: `backlog/` has its own
//     README contract, `handoffs/` is one file per session and `acceptance/owner-queue/` is
//     transient by design. They are described as directories in the README instead.
//  2. ORPHANED - a row naming a file that is not there. A rename leaves one behind pointing at
//     nothing, which is worse than no row: it sends a reader after a file that moved.
//  3. DUPLICATED - the same file named by two rows. This is the merge hazard specifically:
//     two branches adding a row for the same doc in different sections merge CLEANLY and leave
//     the map self-contradictory, with nothing to notice it.
