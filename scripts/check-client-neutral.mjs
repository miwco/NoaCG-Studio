// THE PRODUCT IS CLIENT-AGNOSTIC, AND ITS OWN WORDS HAVE TO SHOW IT.
//
// NoaCG exports to many playout environments and is committed to none of them. SPX is the
// canonical INTERNAL format and the strictest validation target (root AGENTS.md) - that is an
// engineering decision and it stays. What must never happen is the product describing ITSELF in
// one client's words: "SPX live preview", "Make SPX-ready", "the SPX out setting", "the name the
// operator sees in SPX". A broadcaster reading those concludes NoaCG is an SPX tool, and the
// first customers this product is aimed at (EBU, YLE) come through OGraf, not SPX.
//
// So the rule this gate holds is narrow and checkable:
//
//   A CLIENT MAY BE NAMED AS ONE TARGET AMONG OTHERS. IT MAY NEVER BE THE WORD THE PRODUCT USES
//   FOR A GENERAL CONCEPT.
//
// "Export to SPX, CasparCG, OBS or OGraf" is fine - those are the targets, and naming them is the
// whole promise. "Passes SPX validation" is not, because the thing being described is OUR
// validator. The test is: would this sentence still be true, and still make sense, for a
// broadcaster who will never touch that client? If not, it is the product's own vocabulary and
// has to be neutral.
//
// The gate is an ALLOWLIST, not a heuristic: every permitted mention is written down with the
// reason it is permitted, and an edit to an allowlisted line makes the gate ask again - which is
// correct, because whoever rewrote it should re-justify it.
//
// Run: node scripts/check-client-neutral.mjs   (part of `npm run build`)
