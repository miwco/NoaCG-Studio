// PreToolUse guard for the preview tools' dev-server door, `mcp__Claude_Browser__preview_start
// {name}`: refused in a LINKED worktree, because it cannot serve one.
//
// WHY A HOOK. The preview tools start the dev server in the checkout that owns the launch
// config and then report a port. From a linked worktree that server is a SIBLING checkout's, on
// a port this worktree never listens on, and the page it serves looks exactly like this branch's
// work - which is what makes the failure silent. Measured 2026-09-01 (docs/DEV_PORTS.md
// "Starting a dev server"); between 2026-09-02 and 2026-09-04 four sessions each spent ten to
// thirty minutes reading a stale page from another checkout as their own
// (docs/handoffs/2026-09-02-b-queue-walks-itself.md, 2026-09-02-g-docs-a-person-wrote.md,
// 2026-09-02-d-leaving-the-wizard.md, 2026-09-02-l-picture-backplate-grows.md). The shell guard
// next door already refuses `npm run dev` with a message naming this trap, and a session reaching
// for preview_start never sees it, because it is not typing a shell command. That is the routing
// rule in docs/MISTAKE_TRIGGERS.md: the call's own arguments plus one stat decide it, the failure
// reports nothing, and the sanctioned alternative can be named.
//
// A REFUSAL, because the check is exact. `.git` is a FILE in a linked worktree and a directory in
// the primary checkout (`checkoutKind` in lib.mjs), and there is no reading of `preview_start
// {name}` from a linked worktree that serves that worktree. The `{url}` form opens a page and
// starts nothing, so it passes from anywhere - it is how the server that `npm run dev:worktree`
// started gets opened.
//
// THE DEEPER FIX WAS NOT TRIED, and review (2026-09-05) is right that this may be patching a
// symptom: `writeLaunchConfig` in scripts/dev-port.mjs writes a cwd-relative `npm run dev` into
// the launch config, and a config carrying an absolute, checkout-pinned command might make the
// harness serve the right tree from anywhere - restoring preview_stop and orphan-free teardown to
// worktree sessions. Whether the harness reads a linked worktree's own launch.json at all is the
// unmeasured half; docs/backlog/preview-start-from-a-linked-worktree.md holds the experiment, and
// if it works this guard goes.
//
// FAILS OPEN on anything it cannot read: no input, no `name`, a cwd git cannot place, an
// unreadable `.git`. COST, measured 2026-09-05, median of five: 102 ms on a `{name}` call,
// refused or allowed, against 42 ms bare node - one `git rev-parse` (through command-target.mjs,
// which loads git plumbing) and one stat. A `{url}` call exits before either, at 53 ms. It runs
// on preview_start calls only, so none of it is paid per shell command.
//
// NOTHING IS EXPORTED. A hook reads stdin at module top level, so importing one to test it hangs;
// guard-preview.test.mjs spawns this file with real event JSON instead.
