// PreToolUse guard for the background-task chip (`mcp__ccd_session__spawn_task`): a session that
// notices something worth fixing does it, or files it, instead of handing it back to the owner as
// a question.
//
// WHY THIS IS A HOOK AND NOT A SENTENCE SOMEWHERE. The rule already existed three times over -
// the owner said it on 2026-08-30 ("Autonomous work less Mirko!"), `launch.md` says a chip is
// minted only when starting the work is genuinely his call, and `collisions.md` says work a wave
// surfaces becomes a `docs/backlog/` file and never a chip. It still did not fire, because it
// fires at a MOMENT: the instant a session reaches for the chip tool. `docs/MISTAKE_TRIGGERS.md`
// is the routing rule and this is what it prescribes - a lesson with a tool shape belongs at the
// tool call. It passes all four tests there: the call's own arguments decide it, no facts beyond
// them are needed, the failure is silent (an unstarted chip looks exactly like tracked work until
// somebody asks weeks later, which is what happened on 2026-09-02), and there are two sanctioned
// alternatives the message names.
//
// IT REFUSES RATHER THAN WARNS, which `docs/MISTAKE_TRIGGERS.md` allows only for an EXACT check.
// It is exact for an unusual reason: there is no legitimate reading of this tool that the rule
// wants to permit silently. Every honest use is one the session can declare, and declaring it is
// one line. A PreToolUse hook also cannot warn - an allowed call's reason reaches the user, not
// the model - so "advise and continue" was never on the menu.
//
// THE CARVE-OUT. `launch.md` keeps one legitimate chip: when STARTING the work is the owner's
// decision rather than the session's - real money, a model pick worth his judgement, a scope call.
// The session declares that in the prompt with an `OWNER-DECISION: <reason>` line and the call goes
// through. It is deliberately a marker and not a heuristic: no hook can tell whether the reason is
// TRUE, so the useful thing to enforce is that a reason was stated and recorded, which the chip
// then carries to whoever reads it. A rule with no legal escape gets routed around instead of
// followed. An empty marker is refused - the reason is the whole point of it.
//
// TURNING IT OFF. `NOACG_ALLOW_TASK_CHIPS=1` in the environment disables it for one session or one
// machine, the same shape as `NOACG_ALLOW_PARALLEL_E2E=1`. To retire it everywhere, delete its
// `PreToolUse` entry from `.claude/settings.json`, which is tracked, so the change lands like any
// other. If it turns out to refuse something legitimate, widen it the way this repo widens guards:
// add the refused call to `spawn-task-guard.test.mjs` with the date and what it cost, then make it
// pass.
//
// NOTHING IS EXPORTED, deliberately. A hook reads stdin at module top level, so importing one to
// test it hangs. `spawn-task-guard.test.mjs` therefore spawns this file and pipes it real event
// JSON, which is what `docs/MISTAKE_TRIGGERS.md` asks for anyway - it verifies the stdin plumbing,
// the matcher and the message in one go, rather than a pure function the hook might never reach.
//
// COST: nothing measurable. It runs only on chip calls, which are rare, and touches no git, no
// filesystem and no network - two string tests against the tool arguments.

// ANCHORED TO THE START OF A LINE, which is not fussiness. Unanchored, this guard handed out its
// own bypass: the refusal below prints the template `OWNER-DECISION: <why ...>`, so a session that
// got refused and pasted the template back was let straight through, and any mid-sentence "I would
// call this an OWNER-DECISION: scope thing" passed too. A declaration is a line the caller wrote
// on purpose, so it has to look like one - which is what the refusal message already promised.
//
// `[^\S\r\n]*` is "spaces and tabs but not a newline", so a marker whose reason sits on the NEXT
// line reads as empty and is refused, rather than silently swallowing that line as a justification.

that: a defect you noticed is STARTED, not offered (owner, 2026-08-30 - "Autonomous work less

  IN SCOPE      Fix it now, on this branch. Mention it in the commit message.

  OUT OF SCOPE  File it as docs/backlog/<slug>.md - one file per idea, "## Why" mandatory, the
                shape is in docs/backlog/README.md. The orchestrator plans from that folder, so
                a filed idea is tracked; a chip nobody clicks is lost.

THE ONE EXCEPTION. A chip is right when STARTING the work is genuinely the owner's call rather
than yours - it costs real money, it needs a model pick worth his judgement, or it is a scope
decision only he can make. Say which, in the prompt, on a line of its own:

  OWNER-DECISION: <why this start is his call and not yours>

and this call goes through. Contract: .agent-workflows/orchestrator/launch.md.
Guard: scripts/hooks/spawn-task-guard.mjs - its header says how to turn it off.`;

just this guard switched off. Write the reason out, for example:

  OWNER-DECISION: picks between two pricing shapes, and either one costs real money.
