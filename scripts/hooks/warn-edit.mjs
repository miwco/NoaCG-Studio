// PostToolUse notice for the Write tool. Says one thing:
//
//   THIS NEW MIGRATION'S NUMBER IS ALREADY CLAIMED SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THIS REPOSITORY.
//
// WHY THAT NEEDS A HOOK. A migration number is a scarce slot with no allocator, and two branches
// that both mint 0053 collide in a way every downstream mechanism is blind to: they touch no
// common file, so `git merge-tree` finds no conflict, `merge-order.mjs` returns `clear`, and both
// land into a ledger holding two different 0053s. Nothing says so until `db-push.mjs` refuses onto
// the drifted ledger, by which time both are on `main`. The full reasoning is in
// `scripts/migration-collision.mjs`; this file is the git half of it.
//
// A NOTICE, NOT A REFUSAL, and for a weaker reason than its siblings: this is the one of the three
// guardrails with no dated incident behind it, only the collision class the merge-order contract
// already names. A refusal on that evidence would be the guard being more certain than the case
// is, and the answer is sometimes legitimately "keep the number and renumber the other branch".
//
// WRITE ONLY, not Edit. The rule is about MINTING a number, which only happens when the file is
// created; an Edit to an existing migration claims nothing new. That also keeps the extra process
// off the tool that runs most often.
//
// KNOWN GAP, stated rather than implied: the Write tool is not the only way a file gets created.
// `cat > supabase/migrations/0053_x.sql <<'EOF'` through the shell tool creates one with no Write
// event, and this environment's own instructions steer towards heredocs. Closing it means teaching
// the shell notice next door to read a redirect target, which is a different matcher with a
// different failure mode; until then a migration written that way is not checked.
//
// COST. Measured 2026-09-02 on this laptop: 50 ms on an ordinary Write, which is node starting up,
// because the only unconditional work is a path match. The all-refs traversal costs about 170 ms
// with 97 local branches, and runs only for a file under supabase/migrations.
