// Shared harness for the hook tests: spawn the REAL hook file with one event on stdin, and read
// the wiring in .claude/settings.json.
//
// Spawning rather than importing is deliberate and is what docs/MISTAKE_TRIGGERS.md asks for. A
// hook reads stdin at module top level, so importing one to test it hangs; and spawning covers the
// stdin plumbing, the matcher and the message a session actually sees, rather than a pure function
// the hook might never reach. Exit 2 is the blocking code (`deny` / `warn` in lib.mjs); exit 0 is
// "nothing to say".
//
// The wiring check exists because a hook nothing routes to is not a guard, and it fails silently:
// every call sails through and the tests still pass, because they invoke the file directly. It is
// the one assertion that reads the configuration rather than the behaviour, so it is the one that
// notices a matcher edited, a path renamed, or the two drifting apart.
