// PostToolUse notice for shell commands (the Bash and PowerShell tools). Says three things:
//
//   A COMMIT LANDED ON A BRANCH WHOSE LANDING JOB IS ALREADY QUEUED, so the pin that job holds
//   is now stale and it will refuse when its turn comes.
//
//   A HANDOFF THAT STILL LISTS OPEN ITEMS WAS DESTROYED and no wave plan records where they went.
//   The reasoning is in scripts/handoff-trace.mjs; the destroyed-handoff half is checked FIRST
//   because only one notice can be delivered per call (`warn` exits) and lost content outranks a
//   pin that refuses loudly on its own.
//
//   A PUSH NARROWED THE CI PLAN PAST A RUN THAT NEVER FINISHED: the branch already had a run for
//   its previous tip, that run was cancelled or still going, and the run for this push plans from
//   that tip only. The reasoning sits with the rule below; it costs one `gh run list`, only on a
//   push that updated a remote branch.
//
// WHY THIS IS A NOTICE AND NOT A REFUSAL. Queueing pins the branch at its current commit, because
// queueing IS the declaration that the work is finished (`.agent-workflows/queue-merge.md` §1).
// A commit afterwards is perfectly legitimate - the session found one more thing - as long as it
// re-queues. What is never legitimate is leaving both: on 2026-08-28 one session queued, committed
// more, and queued again, and two of its three landing jobs burned as stale-pin refusals
// (`.agent-workflows/orchestrator/incidents.md`, "the three stacked pins"). Blocking the commit
// would be refusing legitimate work; saying nothing is what cost the two jobs.
//
// WHY IT RUNS AFTER RATHER THAN BEFORE. Two reasons, and they agree. A PreToolUse hook can only
// reach the agent by BLOCKING - an allowed call's reason goes to the user, not to the model - so
// "warn without denying" has no channel there. And the fact this rule needs is whether the branch
// tip actually MOVED, which is only true once the commit has run: a commit that failed, or one
// with nothing staged, leaves the pin valid and must stay silent. So the check is exact rather
// than speculative, and it cannot cry wolf.
//
// COST. This runs after every shell command in every session, so the only thing it does
// unconditionally is a pure text match for a `git commit` INVOCATION. Everything that costs
// anything - resolving the checkout, asking git for the branch and its tip, reading the queue -
// happens only for the handful of commands that pass it, including the module loads.
// Measured 2026-09-02 on this laptop, five runs each: 59 ms on an `ls`, against a 47 ms bare
// `node -e 0` on the same box - so the common case is node starting up and about 12 ms of work.
// A commit costs 195 ms, which is two git calls and a queue read, on the one command per session
// where the answer matters. Re-measured after the handoff rule was added: 49 ms on an `ls` and
// 50 ms on `grep -rn x docs/handoffs/` (the folder is named, but no verb destroys anything), so
// the common case is unchanged; a command that really can take a handoff away costs about 140 ms.
// Re-measured 2026-09-05 after the push rule: 57 ms on an `ls` against 45 ms bare, so still node
// starting up; the push matcher is pure string work, and the gh call runs only after a real
// update push, about once per session.

// --- A push that narrowed the CI plan past a run that never finished -------------------------
//
// `ci.yml` plans an ordinary push from `github.event.before` - the PREVIOUS push - and its
// concurrency group cancels the run still going for that previous push. So a follow-up push while
// the earlier run is unfinished leaves the earlier delta covered by nothing that finished, and the
// new run reports green having skipped every shard the earlier one owed. Sixteen handoffs between
// 2026-09-01 and 2026-09-05 carry this trap and the root AGENTS.md names it, which is the proof
// that prose does not fire here: the moment is the push, and the fact that decides it - was the
// earlier run still going - is one `gh run list` away, on the one command per session that moves
// a remote branch.
//
// EXACT, so it cannot cry wolf: silent when the earlier run had FINISHED, because then the
// incremental plan is right by design; silent on a first push, a no-op and a rejection, because
// nothing was in flight (`pushedUpdates`); silent when gh cannot answer, because a hook that
// cannot tell must not speak. The cancellation may not be recorded yet in the seconds after the
// push, so a run still `in_progress` or `queued` for the old tip counts the same as one already
// `cancelled` - it is about to be.
//
// The decision itself is `unfinishedRun` in command-match.mjs, pure and pinned in its tests with
// the two real run sets it was measured on: the first real event this was fed (sha 43c9d60b, one
// cancelled push run beside one green dispatch) must stay silent, and the real 2026-09-04
// follow-up push (sha a8ce0d1b, one cancelled run and nothing else) must speak.
//
// THE OLD TIP IS LOOKED UP EXACTLY. Git's report abbreviates it, and an abbreviated sha given to
// `gh run list --commit` returns [] with exit 0, so it is resolved to the full sha first - this
// checkout pushed that commit, so it has it - and only a tip git cannot resolve falls back to the
// branch listing with a prefix filter, which `--limit` can truncate. BOUNDED: at most three
// branches per push, eight seconds each, because the harness ends a hook at sixty seconds and a
// hook killed mid-way loses every notice it had collected, including the handoff ones above.
