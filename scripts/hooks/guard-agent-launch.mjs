// PreToolUse guard for the Agent tool: a launch whose prompt names, on its TOUCHES or READ line,
// a path that does not exist is refused, with the offending entries quoted back.
//
// WHY A HOOK. On 2026-09-01 a row was launched on a plausible path nobody had grepped - the
// prompt named the images step beside the SVG drop zone - and ran on it ("the row that named the
// wrong step", .agent-workflows/orchestrator/incidents.md). On 2026-09-05 dictation lost a letter
// and a row's TOUCHES line went to the wrong file (docs/handoffs/2026-09-05-i-offer-nothing-dead.md).
// `scripts/wave-plan-check.mjs` checks the PLAN's table for exactly this and both prompts were
// wrong anyway: the plan is one file and the prompt a session is handed is another, edited after
// the check or launched by hand. TOUCHES is also what the collision pass reasons from, so two rows
// called disjoint on a path that does not exist were never analysed at all. The launch is the last
// moment the path can be caught before a session spends its first half hour on it.
//
// EXACT, so it refuses (docs/MISTAKE_TRIGGERS.md "Refuse or warn"): a relative path whose first
// segment the checkout HAS, and which exists neither in the launching checkout nor on
// `origin/main` nor as a gitignored file. Each clause is a false refusal that review found before
// it landed (2026-09-05): prose has slashes too (`Take/Update/Out`, `and/or`, `I/O`), so a token
// is a path claim only if its first segment is a directory of this checkout; a launcher whose tree
// is behind main must not refuse a file main has; and a generated or gitignored file
// (`.claude/launch.json`, `docs/handoffs/*.local.md`) is on origin/main never and in this tree
// only sometimes. `(new` exempts an entry, as in the plan check; MINTS names what the row creates
// and is cut off the TOUCHES line; a bare basename, an absolute path, `~` and a URL are never
// probed - `promptPathProblems` and `pathProbe` in scripts/wave-plan-check.mjs say why each.
//
// FAILS OPEN on anything it cannot read, and on a git that cannot answer. `origin/main` is
// resolved first; if git cannot say what main holds, the second look this guard promises is not
// available, and a guard that cannot tell must not refuse - so it stands down rather than judging
// on the filesystem alone. Review found the first cut treating "git could not answer" as "absent",
// which is a refusal, against the doc's own rule.
//
// COST. A prompt with no TOUCHES or READ key line is answered by one regex before anything is
// imported: measured 2026-09-05, median of five, 56 ms against 42 ms bare node (the first cut
// imported the plan-check chain unconditionally and cost 66 ms). A wave prompt whose paths all
// exist costs 102 ms - the `origin/main` resolution plus the chain - and a path missing locally
// adds one to two git calls, the rare case.
//
// NOTHING IS EXPORTED. A hook reads stdin at module top level, so importing one to test it hangs;
// guard-agent-launch.test.mjs spawns this file with real event JSON, and the parser it relies on
// is tested where it lives, in wave-plan-check.test.mjs.
