// The launch guard, verified the way docs/MISTAKE_TRIGGERS.md asks for: real event JSON piped
// into the REAL hook file (scripts/hooks/test-lib.mjs), reading the exit code and the message. The
// parser has its own tests in wave-plan-check.test.mjs; these cover the plumbing, the message, and
// the world the hook reads - this repository's own tree, so the "exists" cases name files that are
// really here, and a temp directory with no git for the fail-open case.
//
// The must-not-fire list is the longer one, and the prose case is the one that matters most: a
// refusal here blocks every launch on the machine the moment .claude/settings.json lands.
//
// Cost: twelve node starts, about 1.2 s; a refused launch pays one to three git calls per missing
// path.
