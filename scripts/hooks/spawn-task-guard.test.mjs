// The chip guard, verified the way `docs/MISTAKE_TRIGGERS.md` asks for: real event JSON piped into
// the REAL hook file, reading the exit code and the message it prints. Nothing is imported from the
// hook - it reads stdin at module top level, so importing it would hang - and spawning it is the
// better test anyway, because it covers the stdin plumbing and the message a session actually sees
// rather than a pure function the hook might never reach.
//
// Exit 2 is the blocking code (`deny` in scripts/hooks/lib.mjs); exit 0 is "nothing to say".
//
// The must-not-fire list is the longer one on purpose. A false refusal here is paid by every
// session on the machine, repeatedly, while the mistake it prevents was paid once.
//
// Cost: seventeen node starts, about 1.1 s in total. The guard itself runs only on chip calls, so
// nothing here is paid per shell command, and neither the tests nor the hook touch git or the
// filesystem.
