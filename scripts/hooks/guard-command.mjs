// PreToolUse guard for shell commands (the Bash and PowerShell tools). Enforces, cheapest
// check first:
//
//  1. Dev servers go through the Claude preview tools, never a raw shell command - a stray
//     server on this checkout's port is exactly the "reuseExistingServer picks up the wrong
//     env" e2e trap documented in AGENTS.md.
//  1b. Branches are never created in the primary checkout - it is the tree the landing queue
//     checks out, merges, builds and resets, so a feature branch parked there breaks landing in
//     both directions, silently.
//  2. Commit messages follow the house rules (AGENTS.md "Git"): no Co-Authored-By trailers,
//     no AI/agent/chat-session language, no internal plan codenames.
//  3. Commits never include dist/ or the generated .claude/launch.json.
//  3b. Nobody polls the job queue in the foreground.
//  3c. A push and a workflow dispatch never share one command - ci.yml's concurrency group makes
//     the pair a coin flip over which run survives.
//  4. The e2e suites only start when (a) no OTHER checkout of this repo is already running one -
//     several worktrees are normally live and each config asks for 4 workers, so two overlapping
//     runs exhaust a 16 GB laptop rather than sharing it - and (b) their port is free, since
//     Playwright would otherwise reuse whatever server is already there, with whatever env it
//     was started with.
//
// The commit-message scan works on the raw command text (the message is embedded in it via
// -m / heredoc / here-string), so it is quoting-style agnostic.
