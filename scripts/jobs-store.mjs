// THE JOB QUEUE'S STATE AND ARITHMETIC - everything that can be decided without spawning
// anything. `jobs.mjs` is the CLI and the drain loop; this file is what the tests drive.
//
// WHY A QUEUE EXISTS AT ALL (docs/JOB_RUNNER_PLAN.md has the measurements). Browser-driving work
// used to serialize itself by WAITING: `test:e2e:affected:queued` expands to
// `node scripts/e2e-runs.mjs --wait && ...`, a 5-second poll loop with no cap and no tie-break.
// Three things go wrong with that, and together they cost hours a day:
//
//   1. The agent's shell tool is killed at 600 s, so a foreground wait behind a twelve-minute
//      suite dies with the wait still running and the run never starts. Nothing reports it.
//   2. Every waiter wakes within 5 s of the slot freeing and they all launch together - the
//      exact collision the waiting was for.
//   3. Nothing anywhere shows a QUEUE, so "correctly queued" and "dead ten minutes ago" look
//      identical from outside.
//
// Enqueuing instead of waiting removes (1) by construction - no shell command outlives the tool
// that started it - and one runner draining the queue removes (2), because only one process
// decides what starts. This file's `pending()` output removes (3).
//
// SHAPE. One JSON file per job in <git-common-dir>/noacg-jobs/, the same shared directory the
// dev-port registry uses, so every worktree of this repo - and only this repo - sees one queue.
// A file per job rather than one queue file: two sessions enqueuing in the same second cannot
// lose each other's write, and a half-written file is one unreadable job rather than a corrupt
// queue. Ids are minted with the exclusive 'wx' flag, which is the whole concurrency story -
// the filesystem decides who won, exactly as it does for port tickets.

// was not: the job went `failed`, and nothing ever brought it back - so when the blocker was
// queued twenty minutes later, or landed an hour later, the refused branch stayed refused.
//
// Measured on the night of 2026-09-03: `claude/j-fields-step-per-field` and
// `claude/p-alignment-across-corpus` sat unlanded for hours for this reason alone, and both landed
// the next morning the moment a person re-queued them UNCHANGED. Nothing about either branch had
// to change. The queue was treating "I cannot land right now" and "I must never land" as one
// state, and only the second of those is a failure.
//
// So the refusal now parks the job instead of killing it, keyed on the branches that blocked it,
// and the scheduler holds it until re-running could give a DIFFERENT answer - which is exactly:
// a blocker landed, or a blocker's own session queued it. Holding rather than re-running on a
// timer is the point; the exit-3 deferral loop re-runs the landing within seconds against facts
// that have not moved, which is how a branch can spend six deferrals in four minutes.

 * THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES. On 2026-09-03 two landings were killed at their 45-minute cap
 * (j-0438 and j-0445, the first two to time out in 213 landings). Both owning sessions had
 * already finished, and only a branch's own session may queue it - so two finished, green,
 * conflict-free branches became unlandable with nobody left to say so. Six branches were behind
 * them. That is a missing mechanism, not a permission problem.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT SOMEONE ELSE QUEUEING YOUR BRANCH. "Only the owning session queues" exists so
 * that a session DECLARES its own work finished, because a branch can be green and clear while
 * its session is still deciding what to do next, and no verdict can tell those apart. That
 * declaration was already made when this job was queued, and nothing about the branch has
 * changed since. A retry re-runs a declaration; it does not make a second one. The command is
 * copied VERBATIM, which is what makes that true mechanically rather than by argument: it still
 * carries the `--expect-sha` pin from the original queueing, so if the session woke up and
 * pushed another commit, the retry refuses instead of landing work nobody declared.
 *
 * ONE LIMIT WORTH KNOWING. The retry runs in the branch's OWN checkout, so it executes that
 * branch's copy of `auto-merge.mjs` - the queue has always worked this way, and it is why a
 * landing gates itself with its own tooling. It means a branch that predates a fix to the landing
 * path retries with the old behaviour. A branch old enough for that is settled with a fresh
 * `add-merge` from its worktree instead, which re-pins to the current tip.
 *
 * WHAT DOES NOT RETRY, and this is the whole safety of it: anything CI actually judged. A red
 * gate, a conflict, a dirty tree, a preflight refusal (exit 1) are verdicts, and retrying a
 * verdict is how a queue lands something that was refused. `blocked` (exit 3) already has its own
 * deferral loop, and a red main (exit 4) is fixed by a person, not by trying again. What is left
 * is exactly the set where the machine failed to answer: killed at the cap, reaped after its
 * runner died, or `no-verdict` from the CI wait.

 * at whatever commit it is at now, and it takes `--accept <kind>` and `--onto-red-main`, two
 * deliberate overrides of gates. A prefix pattern cannot exclude a trailing argument
 * (docs/AGENT_WORKFLOWS.md, the `git push` reasoning), so allowlisting `add-merge` allowlists both.
 *
 * `requeue` cannot express either, and it cannot make a declaration:
 *
 *   - It takes a BRANCH NAME and nothing else. No flags, no command payload, no refspec.
 *   - It refuses a branch that was never queued. There is nothing to re-run, and inventing one
 *     would be exactly the "somebody else declared my work finished" this whole rule prevents.
 *   - It copies the dead job's own command, so whatever a person once weighed with `--accept`
 *     carries forward and nothing new can be added.
 *   - It re-pins by `repinnedCommand`, so a commit that arrived after the declaration refuses.
 *     That is the property that makes it safe: it can only ever re-run work already declared.
