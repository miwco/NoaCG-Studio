/**
 * THE HARNESS'S OWN LIVE-SESSION INVENTORY - the third liveness signal.
 *
 *   node scripts/claude-agents.mjs            # what Claude Code says is running right now
 *   node scripts/claude-agents.mjs --json     # the rows, unchanged, for a script
 *
 * WHY A THIRD SIGNAL. The night loop has two instruments and both are inferences from files on
 * disk, and both say so in their own headers. `blocked-sessions.mjs` reads a transcript, finds a
 * tool call with no result, and states plainly that it cannot tell a permission prompt from a
 * session that died mid-call from a call that is still running. `session-liveness.mjs` reads
 * transcript mtimes and measured its own by-name lookup missing sixteen of nineteen agent
 * worktrees, because a worktree-isolated subagent files its transcript under the PARENT session's
 * directory. Neither can see a PROCESS, because until now nothing exposed one.
 *
 * `claude agents --json` does. It needs no terminal, answers in well under a second, and returns
 * one row per live session: `pid`, `cwd`, `sessionId`, `name`, and - on background sessions - a
 * `status`, plus `waitingFor` when that status is `waiting`. That turns two of the three causes
 * above into separate answers rather than one shrug: a wait held by a session the harness still
 * lists is a prompt or a slow call, and a wait held by a session it does not list is a session
 * that is no longer running.
 *
 * WHAT IT STILL CANNOT SEE, stated first because everything downstream is built on it. An
 * Agent-tool subagent is not a process of its own, so it never appears here; a Codex session, an
 * `agy` run and a plain shell never appear either; and a session on another machine cannot. So
 * this is a signal ADDED to the two file-based ones, never a replacement for either, and the one
 * verdict it may assert on its own is the POSITIVE one - "something is running there".
 *
 * THE ABSENT VERDICT IS DELIBERATELY WEAK. `absent` means the inventory answered, listed at least
 * one session, and none of them matched - which is good evidence and not proof. It is reported as
 * "no live session in the harness inventory", never as "this session died", because a wrong death
 * notice to a human is the one cost this cannot take back. Operationally the loop already treats
 * all three causes the same way (report it, count the slot free, never kill it), so a wrong
 * `absent` changes the wording of a report line and frees a slot the contract would have freed
 * anyway.
 *
 * CAPABILITY, NEVER VERSION. Nothing here asks which Claude Code is installed. It runs the
 * command; if the binary is missing, the subcommand is not understood, the call times out, or the
 * output is not a JSON array, the answer is `available: false` and every caller degrades to
 * exactly the behaviour it had before this file existed. The one field whose presence varies -
 * `status` - is probed on the rows that came back rather than assumed from a release note.
