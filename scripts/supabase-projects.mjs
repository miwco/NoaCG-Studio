// ONE place that names the Supabase projects this repository talks to, so the drift check, the
// landing push and the advisor gate cannot disagree about which database is which.
//
// PRODUCTION IS NEVER HARD-CODED. It is whatever `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` names, so a fork or a
// self-hoster asks about their own project rather than the owner's. Deliberately NOT
// `supabase/.temp/project-ref`, which is the Supabase CLI's LINK state: that is per-checkout and
// untracked, so a worktree linked to staging would make a production check quietly answer about
// the wrong database - a confident wrong answer, which is worse than no answer.
//
// STAGING IS HARD-CODED, because nothing in the app derives it: `noacg-staging` exists only for
// the `hosted-latency` job, in a separate free organisation, and the client is never built against
// it. A PROJECT REF IS NOT A SECRET - it is the public hostname every visitor's browser already
// talks to, and `hosted-latency.yml` names production's ref in its refusal guard for exactly this
// reason. `STAGING_SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF` overrides it for anyone who keeps a staging project of
// their own.
//
// WHY STAGING IS HERE AT ALL. It drifts silently. Migrations reach production automatically when a
// branch lands (scripts/auto-merge.mjs), and staging was outside that: it was current only while
// somebody remembered to push it. On 2026-09-02 the teams migrations 0053/0054 had been on `main`
// for a day, `hosted-latency` went red on a PGRST205 for `public.teams`, and the alarm read like
// the hosted-only latency regression the job exists to catch. Naming staging here is what lets the
// same landing keep both projects in step.
