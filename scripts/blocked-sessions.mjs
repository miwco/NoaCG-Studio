/**
 * Which sessions are WAITING on a tool call that never came back?
 *
 * The watch loop in `.agent-workflows/orchestrator.md` could previously only see a branch tip
 * that had stopped moving, and a branch tip is the wrong instrument: a session commits every
 * completed step, so it can work for hours between commits, and it can also stop dead the
 * instant after a commit. Those two look identical from outside, and on 2026-08-29 the loop
 * called the first one the second - a session was written up as having hung for seven hours
 * when it had in fact committed, run a long blocking review leg, integrated `main` and run a
 * full nine-shard suite. Nothing was wrong with the session; the instrument could not see it.
 *
 * THE SIGNAL. Claude Code appends every turn to a JSONL transcript as it happens:
 *
 *   ~/.claude/projects/<sanitised-cwd>/<session>.jsonl                    an ordinary session
 *   ~/.claude/projects/<sanitised-cwd>/<session>/subagents/<agent>.jsonl  a wave subagent
 *
 * An assistant turn that calls a tool is written when the CALL is made; the matching
 * `tool_result` is written when the call comes BACK. So a transcript whose last entry is an
 * assistant message containing `tool_use` is, at that moment, a session waiting on that tool.
 * Everything else - a text answer, a tool_result - is a session that is not waiting.
 *
 * WHAT THE WAIT MEANS was, until the third signal below, deliberately not guessed here, because
 * the transcript alone cannot tell the three apart:
 *
 *   1. a permission prompt with nobody awake to answer it (the case this exists for),
 *   2. a session that was killed, or whose harness died, mid-call,
 *   3. a tool call that is genuinely still running.
 *
 * (3) is what the AGE THRESHOLD removes rather than diagnoses. The shell tool is killed at
 * 600 s, so past ~15 minutes no Bash call is still running; a long agent fork or a slow MCP
 * call can legitimately sit longer, which is why the default is 30 and the number is a flag.
 *
 * THE THIRD SIGNAL separates (2) from the rest, which the transcript never could. Claude Code
 * keeps a live-session inventory that `scripts/claude-agents.mjs` reads: a wait held by a session
 * the harness still lists is (1) or (3), and a wait held by a session it does not list is (2).
 * That signal is a capability probe, not a version check, and it fails to `unknown` on any
 * machine where the inventory does not answer - on which this script reports exactly what it
 * reported before the signal existed. It never converts a wait into a non-finding: every row that
 * qualified still appears, now carrying what is known about the process behind it.
 *
 * THE FOURTH SIGNAL separates (2) from (1) and (3), which the process probe never could: has the
 * transcript been WRITTEN TO since the conversation's last timestamped entry? Claude Code appends
 * trailing records of its own - `bridge-session`, `last-prompt`, `custom-title`, `mode` - when a
 * session ends, and those carry no timestamp, so they move the file's mtime past the newest entry
 * that has one. Measured on 2026-09-04: every live in-flight call had a gap of 0.0-0.1 s, and
 * finished sessions whose tail ended on an unresolved call had gaps of 54 s, 6 min, 50 min and
 * 6.6 h. A session that is really waiting stops writing at the call and the gap stays pinned at
 * zero; a session that finished has been written to since.
 *
 * The anchor is the newest timestamped entry, not the pending call's own timestamp, and the
 * difference is load-bearing: a BATCH where one call is held at a prompt and another comes back
 * writes that other result after the held call, so measuring from the held call would call a
 * genuine wait "moved on" every time a batch was involved.
 *
 * All three want the same answer from the loop - REPORT IT, never kill it (orchestrator.md,
 * "The watch loop"). A stalled worker's slot counts as free; its work does not continue.
 *
 * A session that died days ago keeps being reported until its transcript ages past the lookback
 * window. That is deliberate rather than noise: nothing on disk distinguishes a dead session from
 * a stuck one, and quietly dropping the oldest would drop the worst first.
 *
 * Read-only: it opens transcript files and asks git for branch names. Nothing else.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/blocked-sessions.mjs                 # waiting >= 30 min, this repo only
 *   node scripts/blocked-sessions.mjs --minutes 10    # lower the threshold
 *   node scripts/blocked-sessions.mjs --all           # every session, not just this repo's
 *   node scripts/blocked-sessions.mjs --json          # machine-readable
