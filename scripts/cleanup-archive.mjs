// ARCHIVE-BEFORE-DELETE for worktree cleanup: the half of the mechanism that lets a machine,
// rather than a person, decide a finished worktree is disposable.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. `git status --porcelain` - the clean-tree test every deletion guard relies
// on - says nothing about ignored files, and `git worktree remove` deletes them anyway. Most
// ignored content is rebuildable (`node_modules/`, `dist/`) and some is a secret the repo can
// hand out again (`.env`), but a third kind is neither: bench rounds that cost real money,
// generated galleries, eval results. Two paid rounds have already been destroyed by ordinary
// worktree cleanup (see the archive's own README). Losing those is exactly the risk that used
// to be answered by "a human starts every cleanup"; this module answers it instead.
//
// THE VERIFY IS THE POINT, NOT THE COPY. A partial copy nobody checked is worse than no copy,
// because it reads as a safe round and nothing ever looks again. So the copy is proven before
// the caller is allowed to delete anything:
//   1. the recursive FILE COUNT matches, and
//   2. every relative path matches, and
//   3. every file's BYTE SIZE matches at that path, and
//   4. the totals agree.
// Any disagreement returns `ok: false` and the caller must refuse the removal. There is no
// flag that overrides a failed verification - an archive nobody checked is not an archive.
//
// WHERE IT WRITES. C:/claude/noacg-archives, outside the repo, override with
// NOACG_CLEANUP_ARCHIVE. That folder is the GENERAL archive; the two round-shaped archives on
// this machine (noacg-bench-archive, noacg-lite-eval-archive) are indexed by ROUND, one dated
// folder per deliberate paid run, and dropping whatever ignored content a worktree happened to
// hold into them would corrupt that index. Worktree cleanup archives leftovers, not rounds.
//
// The source is never modified, never moved and never deleted here. Deleting is the caller's
// step, and only after this module says the copy is provably complete.
