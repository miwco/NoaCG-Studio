// Which branch should land on main FIRST, and what does landing this one cost everyone else?
//
// Several worktrees are normally in flight at once (see AGENTS.md), and the safe-merge workflow
// integrates `main` INTO the branch before fast-forwarding. So the order work lands in is not
// cosmetic: landing branch B first means every OTHER unmerged branch must afterwards absorb B.
// The total textual conflict for a pair is the same whichever goes first - what changes is WHO
// resolves it, how many times, and whether they understand the change they are absorbing.
//
// Three asymmetries are worth real money, and this script measures exactly those:
//
//   - FAN-OUT. A branch that conflicts with four others taxes four separate resolutions if it
//     lands first, or absorbs all four itself - once, in one worktree, by its own author - if it
//     lands last. Narrow branches first, wide branches last.
//   - STRUCTURE. A rename or delete is the expensive kind. If B moves a file that X edits,
//     B-first makes X's author relocate their work into a file they never moved; X-first makes
//     B's author fold an edit into a file they DID move, which is the side that knows where it
//     goes. A structural collision sinks a branch to the back of the queue regardless of counts.
//   - SILENT COLLISIONS. Two branches that both mint the next `NNNN_*.sql` migration number, or
//     that both append to a shared registry file, merge with ZERO textual conflict and are still
//     wrong. Nothing about ordering fixes those - they have to be named out loud.
//
// The conflict measurement is real, not a guess: `git merge-tree --write-tree` performs a true
// three-way merge in the object store (using the pair's own merge base, which is exactly the
// base the loser of the race will face) and reports the conflicted paths. It touches no working
// tree and no ref, so this whole script is safe to run from any worktree at any time.
//
// This is ADVISORY. It never blocks and never acts: sometimes the expensive branch is the one
// that has to land, and someone always has to go first.
//
// CLI:

// MEASURE A SHARED-REGISTRY HOLD BEFORE ORDERING AROUND IT. The check above is textual - "both
// branches touch this file" - because that is all it can be without understanding each registry's
// shape. Whether the collision is REAL depends on whether the two edits touch the same ENTRIES.
//
// Worked example, 2026-08-25: `claude/caspar-connect-51d22d` and
// `claude/debate-clock-wire-origin-139b05` both read `hold` over `scripts/e2e-affected.mjs`, each
// naming the other, so neither could ever be the one that goes first. Their edits turned out to be
// disjoint - caspar ADDS three rows (`casparLink.ts`, `SettingsDialog.tsx`, `ProductionPage.tsx`),
// debate-clock MODIFIES the existing `src/templates/` row - so neither order loses a mapping and
// the ordering was not actually constrained at all.
//
// How to check, in one command per branch: diff each branch's change to the file against its merge
// base and compare the PATTERNS, not the line counts:
//
//   git diff $(git merge-base origin/main <branch>) <branch> -- scripts/e2e-affected.mjs \
//     | grep -oE '\^src[^,]*' | sort -u
//
// An empty intersection means the hold is the heuristic being textual, which is the right way for
// it to be wrong: it escalates rather than guessing. `auto-merge --accept shared-registry` is how a
// person records that they measured it. A NON-empty intersection is the real thing - two rules for
// one path, where a clean merge keeps both and only one ever runs.
//
// THE RANKING IS A SNAPSHOT, AND IT MOVES WHILE YOU READ IT. A branch with a dirty worktree is NOT
// LANDABLE and drops out, so the order flips the moment anyone saves a file - and it flips back
// when they commit. On 2026-08-25 two sessions each concluded the OTHER should go first, politely
// and in good faith, because each had read a ranking taken while the other's tree was dirty; the
// standoff was an artefact of two stale snapshots rather than a real disagreement. A third flip
// happened seconds later when one of them started editing again.
//
// So: re-run it immediately before acting, with both trees clean, and treat any ranking you were
// handed by someone else as already out of date. The verdict is what gates a landing anyway -
// `caution` and `hold` refuse whichever way the ranking points, so a flip never unblocks anything
// on its own. Deciding who goes first from a ranking alone is how both sessions got it wrong.

 * and a remote-only branch is work: one sat unmentioned for seven weeks before that site started
 * looking. THIS file answers a different question - "which of the branches somebody can land
 * right now should go first?" - and the ranking is consumed by the landing flow, which acts on a
 * local branch in a worktree. Ranking `origin/x` would produce a recommendation naming a ref the
 * flow cannot take, which is worse than not ranking it.
 *
 * So the split is: ranked if local, NAMED if not, and the reader is told how to promote one into
 * the ranking. Silence is the only answer that was wrong.
