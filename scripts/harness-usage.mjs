// THE HARNESS USAGE METER - what each AI harness actually cost over a window.

//   node scripts/harness-usage.mjs                    # the last 24 hours
//   node scripts/harness-usage.mjs --hours 5          # the last 5 hours
//   node scripts/harness-usage.mjs --since 2026-08-29T12:00:00Z

//   node scripts/harness-usage.mjs --json             # the same numbers, machine-readable
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The owner pays for a Codex subscription and cannot tell whether it is being
// used at all. "Am I paying for nothing" is a question about EVIDENCE, and both harnesses already
// write the evidence to disk and nobody reads it. Every future routing decision - which harness
// gets which work - needs numbers rather than impressions, and the first delegation trial
// (2026-08-29) shows why: it FELT like Codex was working for ten minutes, and it had in fact
// written nothing.
//
// WHAT IT READS. Two transcript trees and one ledger, all local, all append-only, none an API:
//
//   ~/.codex/sessions/<yyyy>/<mm>/<dd>/rollout-*.jsonl   and  ~/.codex/archived_sessions/*.jsonl
//     `token_count` events carrying `info.total_token_usage` (CUMULATIVE for the session) and a
//     `rate_limits` snapshot: `primary` is the 5-hour window, `secondary` the weekly one.
//     BOTH TREES MATTER - Codex moves a session to archived_sessions when it is done with it, so
//     reading only `sessions/` silently loses the finished work, which is most of it.
//
//   ~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<session-id>.jsonl
//     assistant records carrying `message.usage` - input_tokens, cache_creation_input_tokens,
//     cache_read_input_tokens, output_tokens. One directory per cwd, so a wave that ran in six
//     worktrees is spread over six directories; and each agent a session LAUNCHES writes its own
//     file under `<that directory>/<session-id>/subagents/`, which is a second place to look.
//
//   ~/.noacg/agy-usage.jsonl  (override: NOACG_AGY_LEDGER)
//     Antigravity CLI is the odd one out: it writes NO cumulative usage anywhere on disk. Its
//     per-run usage exists once, on stdout, and is then gone - so this file is not a transcript
//     the harness wrote, it is a ledger `scripts/agy-run.mjs` appends to as it makes each call.
//     That has a consequence the report states out loud rather than hiding: an agy call made any
//     other way left NO trace anywhere, and no reader can recover it.
//
//   ~/.noacg/delegation-outcomes.jsonl  (override: NOACG_OUTCOMES_LEDGER)
//     The delegation OUTCOME ledger `scripts/delegation-outcome.mjs` writes - one line per
//     verified delegated task (first-pass? defects? redone by whom?), the evidence outcome-based
//     routing runs on (docs/ORCHESTRATION_NEXT.md §6). Spend says what a harness COST; this says
//     whether the work came back right.
//
// FOUR THINGS THAT MAKE A NAIVE READER WRONG.
//
//   1. CLAUDE CODE WRITES THE SAME ASSISTANT RECORD MORE THAN ONCE. A single request can appear
//      two or three times in one file, byte-identical usage and all, and a resumed session copies
//      earlier records forward into the new file. Summing records inflates the answer by roughly
//      2x. `dedupeClaudeRows` keys on `message.id` + `requestId` and counts each request once,
//      ACROSS files, which is why the dedupe happens after every file is read and not inside one.
//
//   2. CODEX'S PER-TURN FIELD DOES NOT SUM TO ITS OWN TOTAL. `last_token_usage` is emitted more
//      often than the cumulative counter advances: over the 88 rollouts on this machine, summing
//      it disagreed with the session's final `total_token_usage` in 46 of them, by up to 30%. So
//      the meter never adds `last_token_usage`. It walks `total_token_usage` - verified monotonic
//      across all 88 - and takes DELTAS, which also gives windowing for free: a session that
//      started before the window contributes only the part that happened inside it.
//
//   3. A PERCENTAGE IS A SNAPSHOT, NOT A RATE. `primary.used_percent` says how full the 5-hour
//      window was at that instant. Two sessions' percentages never add, and a percentage from
//      four hours ago says nothing about now. The meter therefore reports exactly ONE percentage
//      pair - the newest snapshot it found - and stamps it with the time it was taken.
//
//   4. `sessionId` DOES NOT IDENTIFY A SESSION. Every agent a wave launches inherits the parent's
//      `sessionId` and the parent's `gitBranch`, so counting those reports six agents working in
//      six worktrees as one session on one branch. The TRANSCRIPT FILE is the session, and the
//      cwd the file's first record names is the worktree. That also means the branch table shows
//      the LAUNCHING session's branch for such work, which the report says out loud.
//
// AND A FIFTH, WHICH ONLY ANTIGRAVITY HAS. Its four token counts do not add up to anything.
// agy's own `total_tokens` is input + output ONLY - it excludes thinking and cache reads, and on
// a real run the cache reads are larger than the other three together by an order of magnitude
// (1.15 M against 168 K, measured 2026-08-30). So there is no `total` kind for Antigravity and the
// report never prints one: any single number would be a different number depending on which
// fields somebody happened to add.
//
// WHAT IT CANNOT KNOW. Claude Code's own 5-hour window percentage is not in the transcripts.
// There is no rate-limit event in `~/.claude/projects/**`, so this script cannot report it and
// does not estimate it: token totals are not a percentage of an undisclosed allowance. The Codex
// percentages come from Codex's own `rate_limits` payload, which is why only Codex has them.
// Antigravity has neither a percentage nor any history before its ledger existed, and the report
// says so under its own table instead of leaving a small number to be read as a small bill.
