// Can supabase/migrations/ be applied to an EMPTY database, in order?
//
// One class of answer, checked statically: a migration must not call an extension's function
// before some migration has created that extension, and on Supabase it must call it
// SCHEMA-QUALIFIED.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-08-25 the migrations could not be applied to a fresh hosted Supabase
// project at all. 0003_show_chat.sql used `gen_random_bytes` - pgcrypto - and the extension was
// not created until 0004, one file too late: `ERROR: function gen_random_bytes(integer) does not
// exist (SQLSTATE 42883)`. 0004's own comment said it was creating pgcrypto "so this migration
// also applies on a fresh project", which was right about the need and wrong about the file.
//
// Nothing caught it for two reasons, and both are why a STATIC check earns its place here:
//   - The CLI's LOCAL Postgres image ships pgcrypto already reachable, so the local-stack CI
//     applies all 51 migrations green. The nightly cannot see this class of defect at all.
//   - Production has had the extension for months, so `supabase db push` there never re-runs the
//     early files. Only a from-scratch apply exercises the ordering, and nothing did that until
//     a staging project was created.
//
// A fix could not be added in a later migration either: on an empty database 0003 runs before
// anything you add, so the repair has to live in the file that needs the extension first. That
// makes the ordering property worth asserting rather than remembering.
//
// SECOND HALF, EQUALLY LOAD-BEARING: schema qualification. Creating the extension is not enough.
// Supabase puts extensions in the `extensions` schema, and the CLI's ephemeral migration role does
// not carry that schema on its search_path - so an unqualified call fails even once the extension
// exists. That is the second error the same push produced, after the first was fixed.
