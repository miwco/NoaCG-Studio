// "Am I actually running where the launch said I would?" - the probe that turns a silently
// dropped `isolation` into a loud failure.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The Agent tool takes an `isolation` parameter, and on 2026-09-04 a call asking
// for `remote` was ACCEPTED, reported success, and ran on the laptop in an ordinary local
// worktree. Nothing in the launch result, the agent's output or the listing said the request had
// been dropped. That is the expensive shape of failure for a wave: rows routed to "cloud" to spend
// somebody else's RAM all run here instead, the machine hits its three-to-four session ceiling
// anyway, and the plan still reads as honoured. The same shape had already cost this repo twice on
// 2026-09-03 (the agent registry a session cannot see, and `isolation: worktree` minting its own
// branch name), which is why the launch contract keeps a list of them.
//
// A row that asked for remote runs `node scripts/agent-isolation.mjs --expect remote` as its first
// step. Being told at second one costs nothing; discovering it in the morning report costs a wave.
//
// THE DECISIVE SIGNAL IS THE LANDING QUEUE, not the hostname. The queue directory lives INSIDE
// `.git` (`<git-common-dir>/noacg-jobs`, see `jobsDir` in jobs-store.mjs), so git never clones it
// and never transfers it. A process that can read those job records is therefore on the machine
// that runs the queue, which is exactly the property that matters: sharing the queue means sharing
// the RAM and the one browser-driving slot the whole machine gets. Hostname and platform are
// reported because they are useful to a reader, but they decide nothing - they would tell you the
// machine's NAME, and the question is whether you are ON it.

 *   - queue records, as above;
 *   - sibling worktrees, because `git worktree list` answers from the same `.git` the queue lives
 *     in, and a fresh clone in a container registers exactly one.
 *
 * Their ABSENCE is weaker than their presence, and the verdict says so rather than hiding it: a
 * checkout on this machine that has never queued a job and has no second worktree looks, to this
 * probe, exactly like a container. That case is called out in `reasons` instead of being smoothed
 * over, because a probe that overstates its confidence is the thing being fixed here.
