// Apply this repository's pending migrations to the hosted project, WITHOUT a human in the loop -
// unless a statement can actually lose something, in which case stop and say exactly what.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The rule used to be "a production migration needs the user, in that message".
// That rule protected nothing. On 2026-08-25 `0051_client_table_grants.sql` sat applied-on-main and
// unapplied-on-production for hours; nothing anywhere said so, and `supabase/README.md` had already
// written down what a ledger out of step costs: it is silent until the NEXT push, which then finds
// several files pending, re-runs them against the live database, and fails partway through because
// `create policy` and `create trigger` have no `if not exists`. So the delay was not caution. It
// was the mechanism by which a small, safe change turned into a compound one.
//
// A rule whose only justification is "ask me first" is a missing mechanism. This is the mechanism.
// What a human was actually being asked for is a judgement about RISK, so that judgement is made
// here, on the statements themselves, and the human is spent only on the cases where it is real.
//
// WHAT IT WILL DO ON ITS OWN. Grants, policies, additive columns/tables/indexes, functions,
// triggers, comments, backfills - anything whose failure mode is "the transaction rolls back and
// nothing changed".
//
// WHAT IT REFUSES, reporting instead of applying: DROP of any object, TRUNCATE, DELETE FROM, an
// ALTER COLUMN ... TYPE, a RENAME, DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY, ALTER ... OWNER TO, ALTER DATABASE,
// and a REVOKE from a role on an object this same migration did not create. It also refuses any
// statement it does not recognise at all - a guard that has to be right when nobody is watching
// fails CLOSED, and `scripts/db-push.test.mjs` keeps the recognised set honest by classifying every
// migration in the repo.
//
// Overriding is per-version and explicit: `--allow 0052` says "I read 0052 and I accept what it
// does". There is no blanket override, because a blanket override is the old rule again.
//
// WHAT IT IS NOT, stated so nobody reads more into a green run than is there. This guard is about
// LOSS, not about EXPOSURE. A migration that grants a client role new reach, or replaces a
// SECURITY DEFINER function's body, or adds a permissive policy, is applied without comment - those
// are product decisions written in SQL, and refusing every one of them would make the override
// routine, which is how a guard stops meaning anything. Exposure has its own guards, offline and in
// the build: `scripts/client-grants-migration.test.mjs` (a policy that admits a role no migration
// granted), `scripts/definer-grants.test.mjs` (a definer function that ships with the bootstrap's
// EXECUTE grant), and `npm run check:advisors` against the live project. A `select some_function()`
// is likewise taken at face value; what a function does when called is not visible in the statement
// that calls it.
//
// It also refuses to push onto a DRIFTED ledger. `supabase db push` keys each migration by the
// four-digit version in its filename; an MCP `apply_migration` or an SQL-editor paste records a
// generated timestamp instead, and the damage stays invisible until the next push (supabase/AGENTS.md).
// A remote version that is not four digits, or a remote version with no file on disk, stops
// everything here rather than at the half-applied point.
//
// PROOF, NOT ASSERTION. It snapshots the grant matrix, the columns, the policies and the ledger
// BEFORE and AFTER, and prints the difference. "Applied cleanly" is the CLI's opinion; the diff is
// the evidence. For a grants-only migration the expected diff is a specific set of privileges and
// exactly one ledger row - anything else is a finding.
//
//   npm run db:push                  # plan, refuse if anything is dangerous, otherwise apply
//   npm run db:push -- --dry-run     # plan and snapshot only; never writes
//   npm run db:push -- --allow 0052  # apply, accepting 0052's dangerous statements by name
//   npm run db:push -- --json        # one JSON object, for a caller that wants the plan
//   npm run db:push -- --ref <ref>   # a DIFFERENT project: staging, rather than production
//
// The target is the project `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` names - deliberately NOT the Supabase CLI's own
// link state, which is per-checkout and untracked, so a worktree linked to staging cannot make this
// quietly answer about the wrong database. `--ref` names another project outright, and
// `SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF` does the same through the environment (the escape hatch
// scripts/supabase-advisors.mjs offers). The FLAG exists because the environment form is not
// portable: `VAR=x npm run …` is a shell-ism PowerShell does not have, and the machine this runs
// on is a Windows laptop - so a refusal that tells a person how to re-run it by hand has to print
// something they can paste.
