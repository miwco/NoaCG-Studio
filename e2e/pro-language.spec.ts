// PHASE A's COMPOSER, gated (docs/NOACG_PRO_PLAN.md §15.5, src/ai/pro/language/).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The composer's whole claim is that the platform owns the panel, so the layout
// failure classes cannot occur - and until now that claim was checked only by control runs a
// human started by hand (`node scripts/pro-spike.mjs --control`). Nothing in CI would have caught
// a regression, and the faults this file pins are ones that ALREADY happened: an accent rule with
// no width to be, a block that stretched to the name's width, a supporting line too thin to read.
// Every one of them built green, and two of them reached a paid round.
//
// It composes the four hand-written languages in `stub.ts` because they are deliberately far
// apart - a solid edge-bar package, a carbon block strap, a panel-free serif super, a rounded
// blurred one - so a fault in any branch of the composer shows here rather than in whichever
// branch the house language happens to take.
//
// Free: no model call, no tokens. The instruments are the same ones a paid round is scored by.
//
// WHAT IS PROVEN AND WHAT IS NOT. Four of the five tests were mutation-checked against the code
// they guard, and each failed exactly its own test and nothing else: removing the accent rule's
// width, letting the accent block stretch instead of hugging, painting the block's ink in the
// panel colour again, dropping the supporting-weight floor, and breaking the padding's symmetry.
// **The stress test is NOT falsifiable from the design layer and says so here rather than
// pretending otherwise** - forcing a line to stop wrapping, fixing the box's width, and lengthening
// the name past the auto-fit cap all leave it green, because the assembler's mask and cap catch
// the overflow first. It is kept as a net for a STRUCTURAL change (removing the mask idiom, the
// `width: fit-content`, or the wrap cap), which is the only thing that could actually break it -
// and it is the one that would matter most.
