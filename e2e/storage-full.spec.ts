// WHAT HAPPENS WHEN BROWSER STORAGE IS FULL.
//
// The acceptance pass of 2026-08-06 hit this as a total blocker: after an evening of creating
// graphics, "add to production" silently opened the canvas instead. The cause was a swallowed
// error — `saveGraphicAs` returned {ok:false}, the handler returned early, and by then
// `applyDraftProject` had already replaced the route with the editor's, which closes the wizard.
// The user was left standing in the canvas with no production, no saved graphic and nothing
// said.
//
// What is pinned is not the wording — it is that a failed write is always ANNOUNCED, and that
// the announcement says where the work went. The refusal itself is now injected rather than
// provoked (e2e/_storage.ts says why: the documents moved to IndexedDB, whose quota is measured
// in gigabytes and cannot be filled in a test).
