// A MULTI-COLUMN BLOCK NEVER SPILLS ITS WORDS SIDEWAYS.
//
// CSS multicol has one failure mode that looks like nothing else in the catalog: given a DEFINITE
// height it stops balancing, fills column one to that height, then column two, and then keeps
// going into OVERFLOW COLUMNS to the RIGHT - laid out past the container's own box. A reveal mask
// (`overflow: hidden`, which every masked line in this catalog has) then hides them, so the
// operator's copy does not bleed a hair past the bottom where somebody would see it. It vanishes,
// silently, with the graphic looking finished.
//
// It is invisible to every other mechanism here as well. `fitStagedText` (shared/stageFit.ts) is
// the runtime that shrinks text back into the room a design gave it, and neither of its probes can
// see this: `scrollHeight` reports no vertical overflow because there genuinely is none, and the
// Range it measures the width with returns LINE BOXES, each one sitting inside a column and so
// narrower than the box it is spilling out of. The fit reports a comfortable fit while the words
// go missing.
//
// That is how issue #36 got in. card80's two-column standfirst settled 0.25px inside the height
// the fit pinned on it, at the design's OWN sample text - so this checkout balanced into two
// columns and the nightly's renderer opened a third, and the only thing that noticed was
// `overflow-sweep.mjs` reporting a new `.info-card-mask:x` clip against its baseline. A sweep
// signature is a thin thread to hang a silent-text-loss defect on, and it only ever measures the
// design's default words - the failure is far larger with an operator's.
//
// So this gate asserts the mechanism instead of the symptom, at the length where it actually
// bites: drive every design's prose fields with copy well past its own sample, then require that
// every multicol container in the catalog still fits its own width. WHICH DESIGNS IT COVERS IS
// READ OFF THE RENDERED PAGE - any element whose computed `column-count`/`column-width` is not
// `auto` - never a list kept here, so the next design to set a measure is covered the day it
// lands.
//
// NO play(), for the same reason mark-height.spec.ts gives: an unplayed graphic is already at its
// final LAYOUT, and a mid-entrance frame would read a transform as a width.
