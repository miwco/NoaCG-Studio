// A STAGED GRAPHIC SHIPS THE FONT SIZE ITS AUTHOR TYPED - at its own default sample, at least.
//
// `fitStagedText` (src/templates/shared/stageFit.ts) is the height half of the stage contract: a
// line is held to the room the design gave it, and text past that room shrinks rather than pushing
// the panel taller. That is right, and it stays right. This gate asserts the other side of it -
// that the shrink is only ever the OPERATOR's, never the design's own words shrinking themselves.
//
// It exists because the mechanism failed that way for weeks with every check in the repo green.
// The reserve was a LINE BOX (`getBoundingClientRect().height`, font-size x line-height) and the
// overflow test read a CONTENT box (`scrollHeight`, the face's own glyph box, about 1.2em on most
// faces whatever line-height says). Two different boxes, so any line whose line-height sat under
// its face's content ratio reported an overflow against the design's OWN default text and shrank
// permanently, at load, before an operator touched anything. Measured 2026-08-23 over the whole
// registry: 200 of 290 staged designs shipped smaller than they declare, worst -23%, one design
// typing 103px and airing 79px. No gate here noticed, because every one of them asked whether the
// PANEL moved and none asked whether the TEXT was the size the code says.
//
// WHICH DESIGNS IT COVERS IS READ OFF THE EMITTED RUNTIME, never a list kept in this file: a
// design is staged when its own window registered a box in `__noacgStageFitBoxes`, which is what
// `stageExtraJs` emits. The next category to flip is covered the day it flips.
//
// NO update() AND NO play(), deliberately. The claim is about the design's own sample - the words
// sitting in the emitted HTML, which is exactly the content the runtime calibrates against. Drive
// a field and the claim becomes "the operator's text fits", which is the opposite contract and is
// `footprint-stability.spec.ts`'s business.
//
// `scripts/stage-fit-sweep.mjs` is the diagnostic that says by how much, on which line and on
// which axis; this is the gate that says whether it may happen at all.
