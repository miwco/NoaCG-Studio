// A STRAP SPENDS WIDTH, NEVER HEIGHT - measured over every mark-capable lower third, not just the
// six that take the shared slot.
//
// The rule and its arithmetic live in src/templates/shared/logoSlot.ts; e2e/wizard-logo.spec.ts
// pins it for the SHARED slot, through the wizard, on one design. That left the eighteen designs
// that hand-author their own slot guarded by nothing a gate runs: `overflow-sweep` measures a box
// escaping the frame and a box clipping itself, never a box growing, and
// `scripts/spike-mark-clearance-sweep.mjs` is a free script somebody has to remember to run. That
// asymmetry is exactly how the 2026-08-15 finding happened - four hand-authored designs had been
// growing 5-37% taller with a mark, two of them breaking a name across two rows, while every gate
// in the repo stayed green.
//
// WHY THE COMPARISON IS BARE-VS-MARKED rather than an absolute: these designs have no common
// height, and the claim is not "a strap is under N pixels" - it is that adding a mark does not
// change the number. Each design is therefore its own control, rendered twice.
//
// TWO MARK SHAPES, because the two failures are opposite. A SQUARE crest is the shape that fills a
// well and finds a well taller than the words; a PORTRAIT one is the shape that sets a row's height
// through its own aspect, which is why the shared slot caps the mark rather than fixing it. A
// design can pass with one and fail with the other.
//
// NO play(), deliberately. A preset sets its from-values when play() runs, so an unplayed graphic
// is already at its final LAYOUT - and measuring a mid-entrance frame would read a transform's
// scale as a height. Verified against the played sweep: identical numbers on all five designs
// checked by hand (ls29 139/139, ls17 130/130, lt49 138->155, lt53 139->146, lt11 147/147).

/**
 * The designs allowed to grow, each argued in its own source. Both draw a TINTED SQUARE well -
 * real furniture rather than an invisible centring box - sized against the four lines the board is
 * built for, where the words are 157px and the well costs nothing. Bounding either one means
 * breaking the square or shrinking the mark on the content it was drawn against.
 *
 * The list is checked in BOTH directions below: an entry that has stopped growing is a stale
 * exception and must be deleted, not left to excuse a design it no longer describes.
