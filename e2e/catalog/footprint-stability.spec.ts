// A STAGED GRAPHIC DOES NOT CHANGE SIZE WHEN THE OPERATOR TYPES MORE.
//
// `width: fit-content` (DESIGN_LANGUAGE §5) is the catalog's default and is only half right. On a
// NAMEPLATE it is the broadcast convention - each guest gets a strap cut to their name. On a BOARD
// it is a defect: the same panel is back all evening with different content, and an audience reads
// a graphic that re-sizes itself as a graphic that is broken. A scorebug is the worst case, because
// the operator does not even have to act for it to move - `update()` writes names and scores while
// the graphic is ON AIR.
//
// The fix is a STAGE: the design declares the width it was drawn for (`stageWidth`, emitted through
// `stageWidthCss`) and the text lives inside it. This gate is what keeps that true. Without it the
// 25 scoreboard stages are 25 numbers nothing re-measures, and the next person to widen a chip or
// add a cell would put the movement back with every check in the repo green - which is exactly how
// the mark-height failure next door happened.
//
// WHICH DESIGNS IT COVERS IS READ OFF THE RENDERED PANEL, never a list kept in this file: a design
// is STAGED when its box carries the `--stage-width` custom property that `stageBoxCss` emits. That
// makes the gate grow by itself - the next category to flip is covered the day it flips, and a
// design that loses its stage stops being asserted rather than failing confusingly. A list here
// would shrink silently as the catalog grew and still read as full coverage.
//
// The FIRST version of this gate inferred the stage from the CSS instead - "a `-box` rule that
// declares a width and never says `fit-content`" - and its first run called cr09, a credits column,
// a board. "Declares some width" is not the same claim as "declares a stage", which is why the
// marker property exists rather than being inferred.
//
// LAYOUT WIDTH, not the painted rectangle. sb21 leans its panel (`transform: skewX(-6deg)`), so its
// bounding rect widens as the box gets TALLER - it reported a 3px move on the first run purely
// because a longer name wrapped. The stage is a layout contract, and `offsetWidth` is the number
// that contract is about; a transform is the design drawing, not the panel re-sizing.
//
// THE COMPARISON IS THE DESIGN AGAINST ITSELF, at two lengths of its OWN sample text - a name stays
// name-shaped and a question stays question-shaped. The claim is not "a board is N pixels wide", it
// is that the number does not move. `scripts/footprint-stability-sweep.mjs` is the diagnostic that
// says by how much and on which element; this is the gate that says whether it may happen at all.
//
// WIDTH ONLY, and that is a deliberate half. Height is the other half of the contract and is not
// built yet: nine scoreboards still grow taller when a name wraps to a second row, and alert,
// public-info, quiz and results-board move ONLY vertically. Asserting height today would fail on
// designs no mechanism can yet hold. When reserved rows and `fitPlacedText` land, the height axis
// belongs in this same test - not in a second one.
//
// NO play(), deliberately, for the same reason mark-height.spec.ts gives: a preset sets its
// from-values when play() runs, so an unplayed graphic is already at its final LAYOUT, and
// measuring a mid-entrance frame would read a transform's scale as a width.
