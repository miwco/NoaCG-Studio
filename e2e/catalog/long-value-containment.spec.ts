// A GRAPHIC MUST STILL FIT THE PICTURE WHEN THE OPERATOR TYPES A LONG NAME.
//
// This gate exists because of two defects that every other gate in the repo passed, in designs
// that had just been reviewed, measured and merged.
//
// The first is the reason it was written. lt65 "Edge Rail" set its type with `writing-mode`, so
// it hugged its text VERTICALLY - and nothing in the catalog caps that axis, because until that
// design nothing set type on it. At its own 17-character sample it looked correct and measured
// correct; at 51 its rail ran from y=-5 to y=1085 on a 1080-high frame with its text at 39-1051,
// against a safe band of 86-961. That design was later WITHDRAWN for an unrelated and better
// reason - a name set vertically is a name nobody reads - so the case it exposed no longer ships.
// The lesson it paid for is the one this file encodes.
//
// The second is why the file is still here with that design gone: the same sweep caught lt63
// "Broadsheet Band" putting its dateline 5.5px past the safe edge, through a mechanism nothing
// about turned type - a tracked label's layout box carries a letter-space after its final glyph.
// One long value found two unrelated faults in two designs, which is the argument for the gate
// rather than for either fix.
//
// `type-floor`, `overflow-sweep`, `field-coverage`, `numerals`, the catalog calibration tripwire
// and both baselines were green through all of it. They render each design's OWN sample text, and
// a sample is chosen by the person who drew the design - which makes it the one input guaranteed
// to flatter it. `footprint-stability.spec.ts` next door does drive long text, but it asserts that
// a STAGED panel keeps its width; a hugging design is out of its scope by construction, and every
// lower third except one hugs.
//
// WHAT IS ASSERTED IS THE SAFE AREA, and the threshold was chosen by measuring rather than by
// guessing - the first draft of this file asserted the FRAME and is the reason the rule below
// about mutation-testing is written in the past tense.
//
// It reads the TEXT's extent and ignores the panel behind it, which is the owner's ruling of
// 2026-08-23: *decorative bars and backgrounds may extend beyond the safe area or bleed to the
// frame edge; text, logos and other essential information must remain safe.* lt63 "Broadsheet
// Band" bleeds its paper to both frame edges on purpose and must keep passing; what it may not do
// is put a WORD out there.
//
// THE FRAME IS THE WRONG THRESHOLD, and believing otherwise cost this file a rewrite. It was
// picked on the assumption that designs already ship text outside the safe inset, so a safe-area
// assertion would be a gate nobody could keep green. That assumption was never measured, and it
// was false: driven with the 51-character name below, every lower third measured keeps its text
// on the FRAME - including the rail this gate was written for, which left the picture while its
// words stayed just inside it. A frame assertion therefore passed the mutation test it was
// supposed to fail. At the safe area the same sweep returned exactly two, both of them new and
// both settled in the commit that added this file. The stricter claim was the affordable one all
// along; the lax one was unfalsifiable.
//
// MUTATION-TESTED, which is the only reason to believe the paragraph above. Removing lt63's
// trailing reserve turns this red naming lt63; with it in place, and with the whole category
// driven, it is green.

const SAFE_TOP = 0.08;

// WHICH DESIGNS IT COVERS IS READ OFF THE CATALOG, never a list kept in this file, for the same
// reason `footprint-stability.spec.ts` selects on its marker: a list here would silently stop
// growing while the catalog did, and still read as full coverage.
//
// NO play(), deliberately - the same reason mark-height.spec.ts gives. A preset sets its
// from-values when play() runs, so an unplayed graphic already sits at its final LAYOUT, and
// measuring a mid-entrance frame reads a transform as a position.
