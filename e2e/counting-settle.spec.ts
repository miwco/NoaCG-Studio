// A SETTLED COUNTING GRAPHIC MUST SHOW ITS REAL FIGURE.
//
// Every surface that shows a graphic without a playback gesture - a Home card, a library
// thumbnail, the Browse grid, the operator's preview before the first take, the editor canvas -
// jumps the entrance to its end with GSAP's callbacks SUPPRESSED (preview/settleGraphic.ts,
// preview/simulatorRuntime.ts). A tween still writes its target under that jump; a callback does
// not. So a readout whose digits only ever reach the DOM from an `onUpdate` settles reading
// whatever the opening `set` wrote, which is 0.
//
// That shipped. Measured on main 2026-08-26: ig01 "Big Stat" rendered `0%` against its own
// `data-target="87%"`, and seventeen readouts across eleven infographics did the same - the first
// thing a browsing user sees on a stat card was a broken number. Nothing in the tree measured it,
// so nothing said so. The fix is one `tl.set` per readout in the emitted runtime
// (templates/infographics/igMotion.ts, "THE SETTLE RULE"); this is the gate that would have
// caught it, and the gate that stops the next readout shipping without one.
//
// THE DESIGN SET IS DISCOVERED, NEVER LISTED. `data-target` is the mark a counting readout
// already carries - it is where the count reads its true figure from, so a readout without one
// cannot count at all - and the composed document is scanned for it before the design is
// rendered. A new counting design in any category is covered the day it lands, and a category
// list nobody remembers to update is not what stands between a broken number and air.

// AND THE ORACLE IS THE FIELD VALUE, NOT THE GRAPHIC'S OWN ATTRIBUTE.
//
// Every pass below used to read both halves of its claim off the live `data-target`: the
// expected figure AND the reading it was compared with. That is a tautology, and it hid the
// worst version of this bug rather than catching it. If anything ever rewrites a readout's
// `data-target` to "0" during a take, the count runs 0 -> 0 and LANDS ON ITS TARGET EXACTLY, so
// "the entrance ends on the real number" is satisfied by a graphic airing a zero - and the
// zero-figure exclusion each sweep carries ("a readout counting to zero has no zero form to tell
// apart from its target") then drops the row before any assertion sees it. The worse the fault,
// the more completely the gate excluded it. Filed 2026-09-04 as the hole a walk found while the
// acceptance item for the same code claimed the opposite.
//
// So the expected figure comes from OUTSIDE the graphic: the value this file typed into the
// field, which nothing the template does can rewrite. `figure()` compares them as NUMBERS, so a
// design that legitimately regroups "124213" into "124,213" or prefixes a currency mark still
// passes while "124,213" -> "0" cannot. A readout that is not a field element keeps the
// attribute comparison, plus the new one that matters most: its target must be the SAME FIGURE
// after the take as before it.

/**
 * The number inside a rendered figure - "€124,213" -> 124213, "42.3%" -> 42.3, "" -> null.
 *
 * It takes the FIRST number and treats every comma as a thousands separator, which is what makes
 * a regrouped "124,213" and a typed "124213" the same claim. Two shapes it would read wrongly, so
 * a design that grows one needs this widened rather than a special case: a readout whose leading
 * number is not its figure ("1 of 4,200"), and a comma used as a decimal mark ("12,5"). Neither
 * exists in the catalog today.

// The third order, and the one neither pass above could see. Both of them start from a document
// that has never played: the root sits at opacity 0, so the frame before the entrance paints
// nothing and there is no stale pose to catch. Real graphics are re-entered from a VISIBLE state
// all day - the editor canvas and the Rehearse panel settle a graphic and then take it, and a
// dashboard, SPX or CasparCG take of a graphic that is still up does the same.
//
// WHAT GOES WRONG THERE IS ONE FRAME EARLIER THAN THE ZERO RULE CAN REACH. The zero rule
// (templates/infographics/igMotion.ts) moved each readout's emptying onto the entrance's first
// frame; the interpreter writes every opening value as a set() ON the timeline, and a GSAP
// timeline renders nothing until the ticker next runs. play() is one synchronous task, so the
// browser paints once between play() returning and the entrance's first tick - showing the
// graphic exactly as it was, at full opacity. Measured on main 2026-09-03: a settled ig05
// "Rising Total" returned from play() reading its real 124,213 at opacity 1 and was zeroed 14 ms
// later, which is the owner's 2026-08-28 walk report word for word. The fix renders frame 0
// during the take (templates/shared/animRuntime.ts, noacgEntranceTimeline).
//
// SO THE MEASUREMENT IS THE FRAME THE BROWSER WILL PAINT, read synchronously after play()
// returns - not an animation frame later, which is exactly when the evidence is gone.
//
// The second claim here is about the digits themselves: a count that renders a NOTATION its
// figure never lands in changes shape as it arrives. ig05 counted 8807, 16041, 124213 and put
// its commas back on the final frame while ig04 "Poll Ring" beside it was right, because the
// two builders formatted independently. Discovered the same way as everything else in this
// file: a reading is compared against its OWN target's grouping, so a design that groups and a
// design that does not are both held to what their operator typed.
