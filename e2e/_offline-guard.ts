// globalSetup for the offline e2e suite: refuse to run against a dev server that is not
// pinned to offline mode.
//
// THE HOLE THIS CLOSES. playwright.config.ts pins the suite offline through `webServer.env`
// (empty Supabase creds, empty AI key and proxy). That env is only applied when PLAYWRIGHT
// STARTS the server. With `reuseExistingServer: true` a server someone already started on
// this checkout's port is adopted as-is and every pin is silently skipped - so a developer's
// real .env decides what the suite runs against, while the config still reads as if it had
// pinned it. The failure is quiet and confusing: backend-sensitive specs fail because the
// visitor is signed out, and AI specs stop exercising the offline stub providers the video
// specs depend on. The config comment already says a real key "must never leak into the
// suite"; a reused server is exactly how it does.
//
// WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES, AND WHEN. Measured, not assumed: globalSetup runs AFTER webServer,
// so in a normal run the server IS already listening by the time this executes - Playwright
// started it moments earlier. The guard therefore probes on every run and cannot tell "the
// one Playwright just started" from "a foreign one it reused". It does not need to: it reads
// the env the server actually serves, which is pinned in the first case and whatever the
// developer's .env said in the second. Correct either way.
//
// The early return covers only the case where nothing is listening at all (webServer failed,
// or a future Playwright reorders the phases); it is not the common path.
//
// Cost: one headless page load per suite run, ~1s against a ~5min suite.

 * or a script invoking Playwright some way nobody predicted. globalSetup is the one place every
 * entry point passes through, whatever started it, so the universal net belongs here.
 *
 * It WAITS rather than refusing, because at this point the run has already been asked for and
 * queuing is what the caller wanted anyway: two suites on one 16 GB machine do not finish sooner
 * than two run back to back (measured: 59 browser shells, 35 MB of free RAM, everything else on
 * the box paging), they only make the wait miserable. The cap exists so a mis-detected process
 * can never hang a run forever - past it we proceed and let the machine cope, which is exactly
 * the old behaviour.
 *
 * Skipped under CI: each runner has one job, `activeRuns` would only ever see this run's own
 * siblings on a shared machine, and a hosted gate must never sit waiting on a heuristic.
