// THE STEP RENDERS A PAGE, NOT THE CATALOG (re-design/handoff.md §2b): a first page of 12 plus
// "Show 12 more". Before that it rendered every match - 429 cards and 30,215 px of scroll on
// the step whose whole job is picking one - which is why a spec could name any design in the
// catalog and click it straight off the grid. It cannot any more, and it SHOULD not: nobody
// scrolls 429 live previews looking for "Hairline", they type it.
//
// So `pickDesign` searches first. That is not a workaround for the page - it is the flow the
// step is built around, and a spec that clicked a card only reachable by rendering the whole
// catalog was exercising something no user did.
//
// `chooseType` is the other half: the category strip became ONE dropdown, and since
// 2026-08-28 that ONE dropdown carries BOTH LEVELS (proposal §19 Option A) - the ten CATEGORY
// GROUPS as selectable heading rows, their member categories indented underneath. The
// member-category chip row is gone, so "pick a category by name" is now one `selectOption`
// and no click. The option VALUE says which level a row is: `group:<id>` or `cat:<id>`.

 *  names, so "Tickers" keeps meaning the ticker CATEGORY (21 designs), not the whole shelf. */
