// The static video validators, replayed over REAL model output.
//
// `e2e/fixtures/generations/` holds 57 compositions from a 42-generation benchmark that cost
// real money (docs/HYPERFRAMES_QUALITY.md) - both engines, seven briefs, the sources that
// SHIPPED and the ones a repair round rejected. They are checked in so that changing a
// validator rule or a prompt contract can be tested against genuine generations for free,
// instead of against the handful of documents someone writes by hand while holding the new
// rule in mind.
//
// It guards the failure this codebase keeps repeating: a pattern that matches something it
// was never meant to. `network-url` hit `xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"`; `forbidden-api`
// hit `// deterministic, no repeat:-1`. Both looked correct in isolation, both made repair
// rounds unwinnable, and both would have been caught here in seconds - the rules they broke
// fire on documents that are otherwise perfectly legal, which is exactly what this corpus is
// full of.
//
// The baseline records the rules each file produces TODAY. A diff is not automatically a
// failure - it is the question "did you mean to change what these 57 documents report?".
