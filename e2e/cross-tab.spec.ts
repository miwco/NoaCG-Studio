// CROSS-TAB SAFETY for the durable store (model/durableStore.ts).
//
// The store answers reads from a synchronous in-memory MIRROR, because the whole app reads
// saved documents synchronously. IndexedDB behind it is shared by every tab; the mirror is not.
// And every model mutator is a read-modify-WHOLE-RECORD write - `patchShow` is
// loadAllShows → mutate → save the lot - so a tab holding a mirror from before another tab's
// write puts that old record straight back, and the other tab's work is gone from the database.
//
// That needed no second PERSON and no new feature: one operator with the production open twice
// is enough, which is ordinary. Found 2026-08-21 while looking at whether the Data and Audience
// workspaces could open in their own browser tab (docs/INTERACTIVE_PLAYOUT_PLAN.md) - they could
// not, because the change would have made this the default path rather than an unlucky one.
//
// THE READ-BACK IS FROM A THIRD, FRESH TAB. Reading it in the first tab proves nothing: its
// mirror never saw the second tab's write, so it reports the loss whether or not the database
// suffered one. The first version of this probe made exactly that mistake and looked conclusive.
