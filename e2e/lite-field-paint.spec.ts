// Every field a NoaCG Lite graphic declares must reach the screen.
//
// The defect, from the 2026-08-08 quality round (benchmarks/lite/ROUND-2026-08-08-QUALITY.md
// §4): one generation shipped a lower third that painted the name, reserved a wide band under
// it, and drew nothing there. `fieldCount` said 2. Driving the graphic with fresh data through
// `update()` changed nothing on screen. Static validation, the runtime bench, the type floor and
// the wrap check were all silent, because every one of them asks about an element that IS drawn.
//
// The question that answers it already existed - `structuralIntentCheck` drives every field to a
// sentinel and re-reads the painted frame - and it could not run here: it needs a StructuralIntent,
// and Lite runs no intent stage at all, so `withStructuralFindings` returns early on every Lite
// result. The drive now lives in `src/validation/fieldPaint.ts`, shared by both, and the bench
// exposes it as the opt-in `fieldPaints` that Lite's validator turns on.
//
// Three tests, because a gate that only proves it can fire is satisfied by a check that flags
// everything, and a gate nobody enables is decoration:
//   1. an ordinary Lite compile stays quiet;
//   2. a template whose field genuinely cannot paint raises it (the mutation half);
//   3. it is OFF unless a caller asks - a hand-written template may hide whatever it likes.
//
// THE MULTI-STATE HALF (added 2026-08-09, docs/CONTROL_PANEL_PARITY.md §6) is the last three.
// The drive used to read the frame ONCE, at the settled default path, which is the whole answer
// only for a graphic that has no states - so a field a later operator event reveals read as
// unreachable and would have failed a correct graphic. That was the standing blocker on running
// this check for any interactive category, and it is not hypothetical: the quiz board's audience
// percentages are painted only on entry to its `audience` branch, three events past settled.
//
// Free - no model call, no tokens.
