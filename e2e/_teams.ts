// The team surfaces' test ids, in ONE place.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The stage-3 evidence bar (docs/TEAMS_PLAN.md §7) is an OFFLINE build
// asserted to grow zero team UI, and an absence assertion is only worth the selector it names: a
// `toHaveCount(0)` on a test id nothing ever renders passes forever and proves nothing. So the
// offline spec (e2e/auth.spec.ts) and the signed-in spec (e2e/configured/teams.spec.ts) import
// the SAME constants - the configured run asserts each one is VISIBLE, which is what makes the
// offline run's zero mean something. A typo breaks the positive test loudly instead of turning
// the negative test green.
//
// Note `TEAM` prefixes on the two generic ones: `row-menu` is shared with the graphics library,
// so a team assertion on it must always be scoped to a production card, never to the page.
