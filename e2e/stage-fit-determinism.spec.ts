// THE STAGE RESERVE MUST BE A PROPERTY OF THE DESIGN, NOT OF THE MACHINE.
//
// A staged graphic measures its own lines once at load and remembers the room each one had
// (`src/templates/shared/stageFit.ts`, docs/FOOTPRINT_STABILITY.md). That reserve is written into
// the template as an inline `height` / `min-height` and stays there, so it is not a private
// implementation detail: it is part of what the graphic ships, what `e2e/catalog-baseline.spec.ts`
// fingerprints, and what an exported package puts on air.
//
// Twice it turned out to be a measurement of the MOMENT instead of the design, and both times the
// symptom was the same - the catalog baseline failing under a loaded machine with a DIFFERENT set
// of elements each run, which is a race rather than drift (2026-08-23/24):
//
//  1. A line inside a CSS-ANIMATED ancestor reads its height back through that ancestor's
//     composited matrix. gt04's clock sits in a badge carrying a 2.2s `translateY` float, and its
//     height measured 399.9999694824219 on one frame and 400.0000305175781 on the next. The
//     reserve is a `Math.ceil`, so the design shipped 400px or 401px depending on which frame the
//     fit happened to land on.
//  2. The recalibration that runs once the webfonts arrive re-measures every line "from scratch" -
//     but it left the panel's own `min-height` in place while doing it, so the FALLBACK-face pass
//     became a floor under the real one. Whether the fallback pass saw the real face at all is
//     decided by whether the woff2 had arrived by DOMContentLoaded, which is a property of the
//     machine's load. Measured on the alert strip: a 189px reserve held against a real 188.5px,
//     and the four severity tiles sized inside that panel moved with it.
//
// So this spec asks the property directly, in two independent ways, and it is deliberately NOT a
// fingerprint comparison: it is platform-free (no rasterized geometry is compared against a
// recorded number, only against this same run's other readings), so it guards on every runner
// while the render baseline can only compare on the platform that recorded it.

/**
 * The probes. A short list rather than the whole catalog, because each one pays a deliberate
 * font stall - but a list picked by MEASUREMENT: `al01` and `gt04` are the two designs whose
 * reserves the two races above were actually caught on, and the rest are every other variant whose
 * render fingerprint moved when the races were removed, so they are the catalog's known
 * reserve-sensitive designs. `stage-fit-honesty` covers the whole catalog for the honesty of the
 * reserve; this one covers whether the same reserve comes back twice.
