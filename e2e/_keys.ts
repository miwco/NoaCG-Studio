// Helpers for the KEY-OWNERSHIP contracts (src/components/spaceKey.ts).
//
// Two surfaces want Space and several want Delete / Ctrl+C / Escape / the arrows. Asserting one
// of them acted is never enough - the bug these were written for was an unintended SECOND
// handler firing alongside the intended one, which every existing spec happily passed through.
// So the probes here answer "did the graphic play?" rather than "did the pan arm?".

// The preview iframe carries no allow-same-origin (it can render AI-generated/imported code),
// so these probes can't reach `contentWindow.__activeTl` directly any more. composeDocument's
// `simulate` script instead PUSHES its playhead every animation frame
// (`{ type: 'spx-preview-playhead', active, runId, ... }`, preview/previewProtocol.ts) — `runId`
// is a monotonic counter stamped onto every NEW running timeline, the wire equivalent of the old
// object-identity check against `__activeTl`. Sampling one incoming push is enough: `active`
// tells 'none' apart from a running timeline, and comparing `runId` against whatever was last
// stamped tells 'parked' (the same run survives) from 'fresh' (a new play() started).
//
// THESE ANSWER ABOUT THIS INSTANT, and since 2026-08-29 that is a real distinction: a run now
// releases itself when its own timeline completes (preview/simulatorRuntime.ts), where it used to
// be held until the NEXT play or stop. So a finished run reads as 'none', not 'parked', and
// 'parked' is only observable while the run is still going.
//
// What that means for a spec: to say "no new run started", assert `not.toBe('fresh')` - 'parked'
// pins how long the entrance happens to take, which is nobody's subject. To wait for a run to
// FINISH, remember that idle is the state on both sides of it, so watch for the run to start and
// only then for it to go inactive; polling straight for inactive answers from the idle before it.
