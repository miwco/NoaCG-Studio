// ids have count 0 with no backend; this one asserts the SAME ids (both import e2e/_teams.ts) are
// really rendered by a real session against the real RPCs from migrations 0053/0054. Without this
// half, the offline assertions could be green because the selectors were never right.
//
// IT WRITES TO THE BACKEND AND CLEANS UP AFTER ITSELF. Creating a team is the verb under test, so
// there is no way to prove it without a row; the walk deletes the team it made as its last act,
// and the team cascades its membership rows with it. Names carry a timestamp so a run that dies
// mid-way leaves something identifiable rather than something ambiguous.
