// The signed-in UX walk. The 2026-07 review could only read these surfaces from source — the
// editor's account features render NOTHING offline, so the whole offline suite is blind to them.
// This spec drives them for real against the configured backend and pins the properties the
// review checked everywhere else: the topbar stays one row at laptop widths (signed in it grows
// three more controls — sync, community, the avatar), and the account-facing wording is the
// product's, not the database's.
//
// It also drops a screenshot of each surface into test-results/signed-in/ for eyeballing.

/** The topbar is ONE row when every control shares one vertical band and the last of them still
 *  ends inside the bar. Rows are counted by CENTRE, not by top: the bar centres its children, so
 *  the 34px avatar and a 26px button legitimately have different tops on the same row.
 *
 *  `widestNamePx` re-measures the overflow with the account name forced past its 12ch cap, which
 *  is the only honest way to ask whether the bar survives a long display name: the cap's unused
 *  slack cannot simply be ADDED to the overflow, because the bar carries a flex spacer that
 *  absorbs growth while it still has width of its own. Doing that arithmetic instead reported an
 *  overflow at 1600px where there was none. It is measured in the same evaluate as everything
 *  else so the widened name never survives into a screenshot or a later assertion. */
