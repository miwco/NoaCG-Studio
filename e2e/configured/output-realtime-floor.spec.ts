// THE FLOOR UNDER REALTIME (docs/CLOUD_PLAYOUT.md §3): a renderer whose Realtime channel never
// joins still catches up, and says so.
//
// Every recovery the follow discipline performs is triggered by something the SOCKET does — a row
// arriving with a hole in front of it, or a `SUBSCRIBED` after a reconnect. A channel that opens
// and is never joined does neither: it never closes, so nothing reconnects, and it never delivers,
// so no row can expose a gap. The renderer then held whatever its boot catch-up had fetched and
// aired nothing else for the rest of the show, silently — the same on-air ending as the cold-boot
// bug next door, reached from the one direction the discipline did not cover. It is not exotic: a
// venue proxy that passes the WebSocket upgrade and drops the frames, a Realtime incident, or a
// CasparCG CEF all land here.
//
// THIS CANNOT BE PINNED OFFLINE. An offline build resolves no production, follows no log and
// opens no channel, so the mechanism is absent rather than untested. The equivalent for the RELAY
// receiver — which is plain generated JS talking to two addresses — IS pinned offline, in
// `e2e/hosted-control.spec.ts`; this file is the app's own renderer, on the real wire.
//
// The socket is intercepted rather than the server stopped: Realtime must stay up for the
// operator page in the same run, and "joined and silent" is precisely the failure being pinned.
