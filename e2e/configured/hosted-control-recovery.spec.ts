// THE HOSTED CONTROL PAGE SURVIVES ITS OPERATOR'S FIRST TAKE (docs/CLOUD_PLAYOUT.md §3).
//
// The page rebuilds its PROGRAM monitor once on boot, so an operator opening it mid-show sees
// what is really on air instead of an empty box beside a rundown row marked ON AIR. That rebuild
// reads the layers THE RESOLVE reported (`show.liveCue` as `control_show_by_slug` answered it),
// and it is latched by a ref so it can only ever run once.
//
// Both of those are load-bearing, and the round-1 bug is what proves it: keyed on the LIVE
// `liveCue` state instead, the rebuild re-fired the moment the operator's own first take came
// back round the log - a round-trip after the press, with nothing else on screen to explain it.
// On this page it replayed the entrance the follower had just applied (the graphic playing in
// twice); the cockpit had the same shape and a worse ending, snapping to a stale "off" and
// taking the graphic OFF AIR. A first take is the single most common thing an operator does,
// and the class drives this surface from a phone.
//
// THIS CANNOT BE PINNED OFFLINE, which is why it sits here and why it went unverified so long:
// the defect needs a real durable log to come back round. An offline build has no `control_shows`
// row, no `control_events` to follow and no resolve to key on, so the whole mechanism is absent
// rather than merely untested (`e2e/hosted-control.spec.ts` says as much and covers the local
// half only).
//
// WHAT THIS GATES, MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED. The first version of this file asserted on the
// PICTURE - on air, monitor not blank - and was mutation-tested on 2026-08-21 by putting the
// round-1 bug back. It PASSED. That is the defect's whole nature: replaying `play` on a graphic
// already up re-runs an animation and settles on exactly the picture that was already there, so
// the buggy surface is pixel-identical to the correct one. GSAP does not visibly tick headless
// and the monitor's iframes are sandboxed without same-origin, so nothing downstream could tell
// them apart either.
//
// So the count is the observable: `PayloadStage` publishes how many entrances it has played as
// `data-plays`, and the invariant is arithmetic rather than visual. A take is `update` + `play` +
// `cue` (`takeCueItems`), the `cue` row is status and never reaches a stage, and the follower
// dedupes by row id - so ONE take must leave the PROGRAM monitor on exactly ONE play, before and
// after the row comes back round. Under the round-1 bug the returning `cue` row moves `liveCue`,
// the boot replay re-fires, and the count is 2. Re-mutation-tested with the counter in place, and
// it now reads `Expected: "1"  Received: "2"` - the gate this file was supposed to be.
//
// Underneath that it also walks the path itself, none of which had ever run against a real
// backend: a signed-out capability URL resolves, the boot replay runs against a real
// `control_show_by_slug` answer, a take reaches the durable log, and the layer is still on air
// afterwards - which is the cockpit's ending (a replay that blanks the monitor or drops the
// layer) caught as well.
