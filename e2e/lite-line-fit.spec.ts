// An identity line must not wrap, and a headline may.
//
// The first production NoaCG Lite round shipped a five-line "lower third": the operator's job
// title wrapped onto three rows and every gate passed it, because a wrapped line does not
// escape its frame - the overflow sweep and the runtime bench's stress pass both ask that
// question, and the type floor measures font size (docs/AI_LITE_PLAN.md §1).
//
// The discriminator is the line's declared ROLE, which Lite's schema has always required. A
// person's role, organization or location belongs on one line; a story headline running to two
// lines over a one-line kicker was the best frame that round produced. So this spec pins all
// three outcomes together - a guard that only proves the error fires would be satisfied by a
// check that flags everything.
//
// It drives `compileLiteDecision` directly (the shared compile path both production and the
// benchmark are built from) rather than the wizard: no model call, no tokens, and no dependency
// on the AI step's UI.
