# NoaCG Studio — Brand Manual

**v1.0 · July 2026**

A modern, premium broadcast graphics builder. 

---

## 1. The idea

The identity is built from the product itself. The mark is **three descending
bars** — the shape of a lower-third graphic — that also read as the **N** of
NoaCG. The tool *is* the logo.

The system is **dark by default** (a broadcast control-room / editor feel) with
a single **amber** accent used as an "on-air" cue, lifted by a **restrained
glow**. Premium, technical, calm — never neon, never busy.

## 2. Logo

**Primary lockup:** the bar mark + `NoaCG` wordmark with `STUDIO` set in mono
beneath. `Noa` is bold (700), `CG` is regular (400) in muted grey.

Approved variations (see `1-Brand-System.html`, section 01):

- **Primary / dark** — default, on dark backgrounds.
- **Inverted** — dark mark + wordmark on an amber field.
- **Mono / knockout** — all-white, for single-color or low-contrast placements.
- **Stacked** — mark above wordmark, for square/centered spaces.
- **Wordmark only** — when the mark is already present nearby.
- **Mark only** — app icon, favicon, avatar, corner bug.



### Construction & clear space

- Unit = **1x** = the height of one bar.
- Bar height `1x`, gap between bars `0.5x`, corner radius `0.2x`.
- Bar widths: **100% / 66% / 40%** (top to bottom).
- **Clear space** = `1x` on all sides. Keep it clear of other elements.



### Minimum size

- Mark: **16px**. · Full lockup: **96px** wide.

## 3. Color


| Role               | Name  | Hex       |
| ------------------ | ----- | --------- |
| Base canvas        | Void  | `#0A0C10` |
| Surfaces / panels  | Panel | `#141922` |
| Primary accent     | Amber | `#F6A623` |
| Glow / hover       | Glow  | `#FFC65C` |
| Live / record only | Rec   | `#E5484D` |
| Text / knockout    | Paper | `#E8EDF2` |


**Rules**

- Dark is the default ground. Amber is an **accent**, never large fields of it.
- **Rec red** is reserved for live/record status — nothing else.
- Maintain AA contrast for text (Paper on Void passes comfortably).

## 4. Typography

- **Space Grotesk** — display and the wordmark. Weights 400 / 500 / 600 / 700.
- **IBM Plex Sans** — UI chrome: every reading surface in the app. Variable 100–700.
- **JetBrains Mono** — labels, data, timecode, technical tags. 400 / 500 / 700.

**Where the shipped app diverges from this manual, and why.** v1.0 gave Space Grotesk the UI as
well as the display role. The 2026 app redesign moved UI chrome to **IBM Plex Sans**: Space
Grotesk is a display face, and at 11–14px across dense panels, tables and inspectors it read as
styled rather than neutral. Space Grotesk keeps the wordmark and the display lockup, which is
where the identity actually lives. All three faces are bundled locally in `src/brandTokens.css`,
which is the single source of the palette and the typefaces for the product itself — the app
loads no font from a CDN. The kit's own HTML files below still use Google Fonts; they are a brand
record opened in a browser, not product code.

**Scale**

- Display 64 / 700 · H1 40 / 600 · H2 30 / 600
- Body 16 / 400 (line-height 1.5)
- Mono label 12, letter-spacing `.18em`, UPPERCASE

Both are free (Google Fonts / SIL Open Font License).

## 5. The glow (signature)

- Apply glow to the **amber only**, on a **dark** field.
- Blur ≈ **1.5×** the element size, opacity **≤ 50%**.
- **Never** glow on light backgrounds, never oversized halos, never on the
paper/mono bars. When in doubt, less.

## 6. Graphics templates (on air)

Ready-to-run overlays live in `/overlays/` — each is **1920×1080 with a
transparent background**, built to the rules above.


| File                         | Use                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `lower-third-name.html`      | Name / title                         |
| `lower-third-breaking.html`  | Breaking topic banner + LIVE badge   |
| `lower-third-interview.html` | Interview: name, org, location       |
| `bug-clock.html`             | Corner logo bug + live-ticking clock |
| `ticker-news.html`           | Animated news crawl + category chip  |
| `ticker-markets.html`        | Markets strip                        |
| `title-card-fullframe.html`  | Full-frame title card (opaque)       |


**How to use:** drop any file into vMix / OBS / CasparCG / Singular as a
**browser source** at 1920×1080. The alpha composites straight over video.
Edit the text directly in the HTML. Fonts load from Google Fonts, so the
playout machine needs internet on first load (ask for font-embedded offline
versions if needed).

## 7. Misuse

Don't: stretch or squash the mark · recolor the bars · glow on light
backgrounds · rotate the mark · add outlines or drop shadows to the wordmark ·
place the logo on busy imagery without the dark scrim.
