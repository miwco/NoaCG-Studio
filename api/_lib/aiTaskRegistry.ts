   * rules refuse on purpose: `approvedTextRoute` is false for it, and `fundedModelRoute`
   * answers no for every image entry because the funded PRICE CEILING measures input/output
   * text tokens and no ceiling for image work has been decided (docs/ADMIN.md §9,

   * applies. An image route's spend is held by `maxProviderCostUsd`, BOOKED per generation
   * before the call and settled after it, which is a bound on the whole bill rather than on
   * the half the token ceiling can see.

   * **NO TASK DECLARES ONE TODAY.** Pro's concept route (`google/gemini-3.1-flash-image`) was
   * the only one, and Phase A retired the engine that called it (docs/NOACG_PRO_PLAN.md §16).
   * The FIELD stays because the half of this that matters is `routeConfigured`'s refusal of an
   * UNDECLARED image route - the check that stops an env edit pointing Lite at an image model
   * and discovering it on the first call - and that check needs a declaration to be the thing
   * a task can be missing. It is pinned by a test with no task behind it.

/**
 * The HOSTED NoaCG Pro task: a paid-shaped generation NoaCG's own key serves, admitted and

 *
 * It is registered although its spend flows through the GENERIC gateway proxy rather than a
 * task-owned endpoint, because registration is what makes the allowance real: the admin models
 * page walks AI_TASK_IDS, and `taskConfigured` is the fail-closed gate that stops an env
 * repoint at an unpriced or unapproved route from being billed.
 *
 * TIERS SAY `free`, AND THAT IS ABOUT WHO PAYS RATHER THAN WHAT IT COSTS THE USER. Hosted Pro
 * is the surface the product will eventually charge for, but there is nothing to buy today: a
 * signed-in account with no plan reaches it and NoaCG's key settles the bill. `noacgFunded`
 * reads this label to decide whether the funded-route rule binds (decision 5: who pays decides
 * the route), so labelling it `paid` before billing exists would switch that gate off on the
 * one surface whose per-generation cost is 250x Lite's. It moves to `paid` the day a user's
 * money is what pays. Until then the ALLOWANCE stands in for the price - a small daily quota
 * rather than an open tap.
 *
 * THE ENGINE IS NOT DESCRIBED HERE. The route list is what the profile funds, not a pipeline.
 * §15 replaced the concept-and-reconstruct engine and this entry did not have to be rewritten,
 * which is the property that rule was for: the only thing that moved is how many routes the
 * profile funds, and this reads that rather than naming stages.
